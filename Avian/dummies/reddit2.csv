The group proposed to collect and conduct genetic recombination experiments on SARS-related coronaviruses possessing specific traits making them “high-risk” for zoonotic spillover into animals and humans.121 Notably, the proposal describes the WIV’s intent to search for SARS-related coronaviruses with potential to bind to human ACE2 receptors and that have naturally occurring furin cleavage sites in Yunnan Province, China.122 According to the proposal, if WIV researchers were unable to find a SARS-related virus with these traits during sampling expeditions, they then proposed to manipulate the ACE2 receptors of SARS-related coronaviruses to increase binding affinity to human lung tissue and to insert furin cleavage sites at the same location where one appears in SARS-CoV-2.123 This proposal was not ultimately funded by DARPA. Furin cleavage sites are known to enhance virulence and increase viral replication in avian influenza and Ebola viruses. The grant proposal is in line with research trends in the field of virology in China. In 2015, researchers at Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan inserted an artificial furin 15 cleavage site in Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (an alpha coronavirus).124 In 2019, researchers in China inserted a four amino acid furin cleavage site into Infectious Bronchitis coronavirus that affects poultry.125 The WIV also received funding from PRC government agencies for research examining the spillover potential of SARS-related coronaviruses.126

&gt;Furin cleavage sites are known to enhance virulence and increase viral replication in avian influenza and Ebola viruses.

&gt; Scientists at the WIV have created chimeras, or combinations, of SARS-like coronaviruses through genetic engineering, attempted to clone other unrelated infectious viruses, and used reverse genetic cloning techniques on SARS- like coronaviruses.

&gt; Some of the WIV’s genetic engineering projects on coronaviruses involved techniques that could make it difficult to detect intentional changes. A 2017 dissertation by a WIV student showed that reverse genetic cloning techniques—which are standard techniques used in advanced molecular laboratories—left no traces of genetic modification of SARS-like coronaviruses.

'For years, Canadian farmers and government agencies have waged a fierce battle against the new wave of avian flu, which experts say is much more transmissible than previous variants of the virus.

'CHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I. — Avian flu has been found in skunks in P.E.I. as well as affecting a wide range of bird species and foxes in the province, says the regional director of the Canadian Wildlife Health Co-operative.  
“The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 was first detected in P.E.I. just over a year ago, so we’ve been dealing with it on the Island all that time,” said Dr. Megan Jones, who is also an associate professor with the Atlantic Veterinary College.   
Jones said even though the disease primarily affects birds, it has also popped up in mammal species. '

• most often spread by contact between infected and healthy birds

• can also be spread indirectly through contaminated equipment

• spread to people often through direct contact with infected poultry, such as during slaughter or plucking

• though the virus can spread through airborne secretions, the disease itself is not an airborne disease

Fear we go again! UK health officials including 'Professor Lockdown' begin Covid-style 'worst-case scenario' planning for if bird flu becomes transmissible in humans - as girl, 11, dies and TWELVE more people are feared infected in Cambodia  
  
Scientists are modelling how an outbreak of avian flu could sweep the UK  
Only one infection has been spotted in a Brit since outbreak began in 2021  
24 February 2023  


'Yet fears of another pandemic are quickly notching up.  
Cases of the H5N1 strain have already jumped from birds to mammals.  
It has sparked huge concern among top virologists that the deadly pathogen is now one step closer to spreading in humans — a hurdle which has so far stopped it from triggering a pandemic.  
Among those working on the models is Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist whose chilling projections of the Covid outbreak led the UK Government to impose the first lockdown.  
It comes as a dozen people in Cambodia are suspected of being infected with H5N1 in the same province where an 11-year-old girl died on Wednesday — raising fears the virus may even be spreading from human to human. '

'Most of these cases are probably caused by a mammal eating an infected bird, Jürgen Richt, who studies avian flu at Kansas State University, tells USA Today. But in a paper published in January in the journal Eurosurveillance, researchers document evidence that the virus might have spread between minks on a farm in Spain last October. **Genetic sequencing revealed a genetic change known to make some influenza viruses more capable of reproducing in mammals, writes Nature News’ Saima May Sidik.**  
  
**The mink outbreak “confirmed a fear that I had” that bird flu could spread efficiently in mammals, Thijs Kuiken, a veterinary pathologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, tells the Times.**  
  
**“We’ve never seen mammal-to-mammal transmission, ever. It has never happened,” Wille says to the Sydney Morning Herald. “Now it’s no longer just a hypothetical. Now we’ve actually seen it happen.”**  
  
Experts say this development is not a cause for alarm. “It’s not, in my mind, a particularly worrisome situation for human health,” Jim Lowe, a veterinarian at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, tells the Times. “Obviously it’s not very good for the mink.”  
  
The tightly packed, caged minks could have transmitted H5N1 due to their conditions rather than a fundamental change in the virus, Frank Wong, a bird flu expert at Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, tells the Sydney Morning Herald. “It’s still a bird-adapted virus.”  
  
But evidence of spread between mammals is also a warning sign, others say. “This outbreak signals the very real potential for the emergence of mammal-to-mammal transmission,” Wille told the CBC News’ Lauren Pelley in an email.  
  
“We need to be vigilant to make sure that spread in animals is contained,” Briand tells the AFP. “The more the virus circulates in animals, the higher is the risk for humans as well.”

Preprint: First Mass Mortality of Marine Mammals Caused by Highly Pathogenic Influenza Virus (H5N1) in South America  


'Earlier this week, in Peru: SERNANP Reports At Least 585 Sea Lions &amp; 50,000 birds killed by Avian Flu. we learned of the large-scale die off of sea lions due to HPAI H5N1.  While this is not the first instance of H5N1 infecting marine mammals (see here, here, and here), it is the largest, and deadliest to date.   
We've seen other avian flu viruses infect and kill marine mammals, including H3N8 in New England (2011), H10N8 in Germany (2014), and H5N8 in the Baltic Sea (2017), but this outbreak comes on the heels of suspected mammal-to-mammal transmission of H5N1 in farmed mink, raising concerns this could be another example.   
Today researchers from Argentina and Peru have published a preprint on their investigation into this die off, where they state that mammal-to-mammal transmission of the virus cannot be ruled out. '

Pardon me if I humiliate you by talking to you like a child, but here's why your evidence doesn't work.

Currently, the states has no supply management and prices are X.  Your claim is that supply management could significantly reduce prices.

Saying that X is higher than prices in some other country (Canada) is not proof since Canada doesn't have avian flu, for example.

To show your claim you would need to do an experiment (or quasi-experiment).   For example, if they temporarily instituted supply management, that would be an experiment.

You could find a country that added or removed supply management and track prices immediately after (e.g. Australia).

You could find an instrumental variable (quasi-experient), or use the front door or back door method of causal inference.

In short, **you have no idea what the prices would be in the states were they to institute supply management. That is, you cannot make a counterfactual claim.**

This is what I told you in the last comment.

From the article: “Eggs are bought and sold on the commodity market, where farmers don’t set the price of eggs — the market does,” a representative wrote in an email to the Daily Yonder.


Further: 

A farmer-advocacy organization says record-breaking increases in the price of eggs isn’t being caused by inflation or avian flu, as claimed by egg companies, but by price collusion among the nation’s top egg producers.

In a letter sent to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) last week, the organization Farm Action accused the country’s dominant egg producers of scheming to raise prices. 

“The real culprit behind this 138% hike in the price of a carton of eggs appears to be a collusive scheme among industry leaders to turn inflationary conditions and an avian flu outbreak into an opportunity to extract egregious profits reaching as high as 40%,” read the Farm Action letter to the FTC.  

The average price of a dozen eggs jumped from $1.79 in December 2021 to $4.25 in December 2022. To explain the increase, industry leaders have cited inflation plus the avian flu outbreak, which began in February 2022 and has killed more than 43 million commercial egg-laying hens, according to USDA data.

The avian flu outbreak in 2015 was deadlier but did not produce price spikes as high as those seen in 2022. The 2015 outbreak killed about 12% of the egg-laying hens in the U.S. Most of the 50 million birds that died were egg-laying hens and turkeys, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service (ERS).

&gt;British Columbia has released a strategy to combat the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) as the virus continues to move across North America.

The province has asked residents to report any cervids that appear sick immediately.
&gt;

This H5N1 virus doesn't care if people want to hear about it or not, or if they're tired of these pesky pandemics.  


'What to do  
In 2006, when scientists discovered that H5N1 did not spread easily among humans because it lodged in the lower respiratory tract, a group of researchers at Erasmus University Medical Center pointed out that if the virus had evolved by attaching itself to receptors in the lower respiratory tract upper respiratory tract – becoming more easily transmissible by air – the risk of a pandemic among humans would have increased significantly. The outbreak in the mink farm in Spain is a sign that perhaps we are moving in that direction. The warning signs of a potentially catastrophic pandemic could not be clearer.  
  
“This event reminds us that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus is not just a problem for birds,” explains Isabella Monne. «An unprecedented global epidemic emergency is underway, which not only disrupts poultry production but is seriously affecting many species of wild birds and sporadically also wild mammals, seriously threatening the biodiversity of our planet. The continuous circulation of the virus in the wild population and the massive mortality caused by the spread of the infection in some species risks further unbalancing ecosystems with unknown consequences also on the evolutionary dynamics of the virus. This emergency too must be faced with a One Health, global and multidisciplinary approach, with the utmost attention and promptness, as we have begun to understand thanks to the lesson of the Covid-19 pandemic. An influenza virus capable of causing spillover in mammals must be stopped before it becomes a public health problem.  
  
The public certainly doesn’t want to hear about another virus, but pandemic flus happen with regularity in human history, regardless of whether we are tired or have recovered from the previous ones. This time, in addition to the alarm bells, we have at our disposal many of the tools needed to avoid a new pandemic. What is missing is a greater sense of urgency and immediate action.'

‘Incredibly concerning’: Bird flu outbreak at Spanish mink farm triggers pandemic fears  
Spread among captive mink could give the H5N1 strain opportunities to evolve and adapt to mammals  


24 JAN 2023 PMBYKAI KUPFERSCHMIDT

'When mink at a big farm in Galicia, a region in northwestern Spain, started to die in October 2022, veterinarians initially thought the culprit might be SARS-CoV-2, which has struck mink farms in several other countries. But lab tests soon revealed something scarier: a deadly avian influenza virus named H5N1. Authorities immediately placed workers on the farm under quarantine restrictions. The more than 50,000 mink at the facility were killed and their carcasses destroyed.

None of the farm workers became infected. But the episode, described in a paper in Eurosurveillance last week, has reignited long-smoldering fears that H5N1 could trigger a human pandemic. The virus is not known to spread well between mammals; people almost always catch it from infected birds, not one another. But now, H5N1 appears to have spread through a densely packed mammalian population and gained at least one mutation that favors mammal-to-mammal spread. Virologists warn that H5N1, now rampaging through birds around the world, could invade other mink farms and become still more transmissible.

“This is incredibly concerning,” says Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London. “This is a clear mechanism for an H5 pandemic to start.” Isabella Monne, a veterinary researcher at the European Union’s Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza in Italy, where the samples from Spain were sequenced, calls the finding “a warning bell.”

Last week, it was announced it was found in pigs (which scientists had previously said would be extremely alarming). Now we have a teenager in critical condition with it.

To be clear: it has NOT gone human-to-human yet. But the issue is that a reassortment event is now increasingly likely, much more so than it has been at any other point in time. The upcoming flu season will give it additional reassortment opportunities.

If it goes human-to-human, there possibility for fuckery is off the richter for three reasons. First, based on historical animal-to-human cases and ferret studies, it could have an IFR an order of magnitude higher than COVID. In an immunologically naive population, COVID had a fatality rate of about 0.5% - estimates for bird flu range from 10% to even 40-50%. Second, whereas COVID mainly killed elderly people, H5N1 kills young people (see: this case in critical condition as an example). 

Third, because we just finished a pandemic, if this shit blows up, there will be *zero* public or policymaker appetite for trying to slow it down (at least initially) - the public is totally over pandemic control measures. I expect that if it maintains a high fatality rate and if it's age stratified towards kids/teens like COVID was towards elderly, those attitudes will change in relatively short order - but it might take a couple months, at which point it'll be too late.

The only saving grace is that it may have a much lower R0 (spread rate) than COVID, which would help to blunt its effect.

&lt;p&gt;The only saving grace is that it may have a much lower R0 (spread rate) than COVID, which would help to blunt its effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really, really hoping this does not go human-to-human. But having kept an eye on it, the virus is now only a chess move or two away from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

The USDA Isn't Inspiring Confidence With Its Bird Flu Response | Opinion  
Published Apr 04, 2024   
By Andrew deCoriolis and Gail Hansen  
Executive Director of Farm Forward; Public Health Veterinary Expert  
[https://www.newsweek.com/usda-isnt-inspiring-confidence-its-bird-flu-response-opinion-1887130](https://www.newsweek.com/usda-isnt-inspiring-confidence-its-bird-flu-response-opinion-1887130)  


'Now this week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the first case of the virus apparently spreading from cow to human. The USDA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in matching statements, were quick to assure the public that everything is fine.  
But the potential risks of this spillover event are much bigger than either the government or industry leaders seem ready to publicly admit. The American food system relies on factory farming of animals, pushing hundreds of millions of them together into inhumane, unsanitary, dangerously overcrowded conditions. It's the perfect breeding ground for viruses, increasing the risk of mutations, the risk of rapid spread, and the risk of farm workers getting infected through direct exposure.'  


'The USDA ends by saying farmers are ""urged"" to make changes to reduce the spread of disease. But as a longtime watchdog of the industry and a veterinary epidemiologist, we've seen time and again how large agricultural corporations sacrifice health, safety, and the humane treatment of animals in the pursuit of profit. There is no reason they'll change now. But this time, the stakes are too high to ignore. The USDA needs to make it clear that they have a handle on this problem before it's too late.

&lt;p&gt;The USDA Isn&amp;#39;t Inspiring Confidence With Its Bird Flu Response | Opinion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Now this week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the first case of the virus apparently spreading from cow to human. The USDA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in matching statements, were quick to assure the public that everything is fine.&lt;br/&gt;
But the potential risks of this spillover event are much bigger than either the government or industry leaders seem ready to publicly admit. The American food system relies on factory farming of animals, pushing hundreds of millions of them together into inhumane, unsanitary, dangerously overcrowded conditions. It&amp;#39;s the perfect breeding ground for viruses, increasing the risk of mutations, the risk of rapid spread, and the risk of farm workers getting infected through direct exposure.&amp;#39;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;The USDA ends by saying farmers are &amp;quot;urged&amp;quot; to make changes to reduce the spread of disease. But as a longtime watchdog of the industry and a veterinary epidemiologist, we&amp;#39;ve seen time and again how large agricultural corporations sacrifice health, safety, and the humane treatment of animals in the pursuit of profit. There is no reason they&amp;#39;ll change now. But this time, the stakes are too high to ignore. The USDA needs to make it clear that they have a handle on this problem before it&amp;#39;s too late.&lt;br/&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

For example the 2011 bird flu study that resulted in the 2014 ban on enhanced pathogen research during the Obama administration. Well this study was developed a mutant version of Bird Flu (a virus that kills 70% of humans infected, but cannot spread between humans or mammals and has a very hard time infecting humans) that was not only able to spread between mammals, but can do so via airborne transmission! Well guess what, in 2019 a research at the university of Wisconsin got exposed to this mutant version of bird flu and not only did the university not inform the public, they even failed to follow quarantine procedures: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/04/11/lab-leak-accident-h-5-n-1-virus-avian-flu-experiment/11354399002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/04/11/lab-leak-accident-h-5-n-1-virus-avian-flu-experiment/11354399002/)

&amp;#x200B;

So if that worker who got exposed ended up infected, we would have an airborne virus that kills up to 70% of people infected. And if there was a leak you can bet the public would not be informed until it was too late. You see these experiments claim that they are trying to predict future mutations, but in the 13 years since Bird Flu is no where close to developing these features. And you wanna know why? It's because the forced conditions in a lab result in evolutionary pressures that do not exist in the wild, these viruses are like the store bought banana of viruses i.e. the mutations in the lab happening in the wild is as likely as a seedless easy peel banana evolving in the wild on it's own.

Now, as for my reply to your comment.

You should look back to the early 2000's to see the real culprits of what's going on today. Everything we are experiencing right now, is an end result of kicking this can down the road a decade or so at a time.

We very nearly had the exact same scenario back in 2003 or so. Things didn't quite line up just right though for it be considered a full on black swan event in the same way we treat these past few years. But all the key players were there. SARS was becoming pandemic level, with a few other nasties around the corner like bird flu and swine flu. Climate crisis talk was at an all time high back then, with hollywood making bank off of crisis flicks. Things that extreme right wing and fundamentalists hated were being nearly made legal or decriminalized at least, like marijuana. Housing crisis was just starting. Banks were running far too much risk once again. And... pretty sure this is roughly when Russia started to get ... neighborly... with places like Georgia. (Just checked, 2008)

It's this decade that all of these things, and more, all seem to be happening in lockstep this time, where as last decades things just weren't quite... ready. Ready for what?

One TIME magazine a long time ago, I think it was TIME... made an article about how there was going to be this 'green transition' planned for now for decades, and the time was ripe to enact it.

And then, it didn't happen. We went back to the same old normal of guzzling gas, pumping oil, etc and so forth. Building homes that are effectively short lived boxes with shitty insulation and thin walls, etc. All because it was cheap and affordable, and look at that profit margin grow.

Liberals are pulling us through the muck they intended to pull us through 20 years ago. And the evidence is all there for anyone to see. All they need to do is do is some reading some evening.   


They basically straight up warned us that going back to the CPC would result in all of this coming back again some decade or so later to be dealt with again when the time comes. Many didn't listen.

Pointing at crime is a red herring. What are the causes of crime and how do we combat them? Poverty, often caused by war and hunger. Drug abuse which is directly related to gangs and mental illness and homelessness. Homelessness causes crime. Neither the libs nor cons cared about these issues in the last 20 years. More Canadians die of overdoses than the current estimate of Ukranians killed in free Ukraine. Not to mention gang violence.

I am against increased military spending. Im not sure we should be involved in Ukraine at all. Two very corrupt ex soviet countries are in conflict. We were not involved in Etheopia nor in Argentina why should we be involved in Ukraine?

The liberals often fail to solve real problems so they have never had my vote. The cons run on bigotry however I might vote for a so-con if I believed them. The NDP focus on things we. An do idealistically but im not sure we can actually afford dental care. As much as it will enrich Canadians. Got to spend money to do anything yeah?

So this black and white you vs us thing you imagine is a joke. We are not a one party cult you seem to think we are.

Is it not okay to critique a government I found to be worse than this one? Putting Canadians on the line for oil spills and well cleanups and guaranteeing decades of energy to China and cutting jobs in my field, yeah, I have a lot of resentment for Harper. For arresting journalists, for supressing and muzzling scientists, firing all our ecologists, tampering with data, election fraud and lots of money given to his homeboys? Yeah... Harper and Trudeau are very comparable. Imo at least Trudeau is trying to deal with 3rd world poverty in Canada and yeah thats expesnive now but when all those people enter the modern economy we will become wealthier by default.

Did Harper involve us in a war that causes mass refugees to immigrate here? Gee... Now we have housing problems and the cons blame immigration... Im not sure how not to equate the two. So yes, bad decisions 20 years ago do impact the world today. Thats nothing new. Many of our laws predate either of those governments... If we reversed all their laws we would be the authoritarians some imagine the minority government to be... Compromise is where democracies thrive.

Can Trudeau control the weather? No. Crop loss across the continent and import crops are not something we can control yet. What about wars and US sanctions on fertilizer (cost of agriculture)? Warm weather incubating a bird flu (cost of eggs)? What about foreign wars impacting supply chains? Also nope. Can Canada force China to fix their supply chain issues and ending absurdly overdone covid measures? Nope not our jurisdiction. What about the covid measures here? Well I dont think we did enough, ive been left a cripple from a roomate who could not get of tinder so ""doing nothing"" to save money would have been absolutely the wrong move. Im not saying what they did was the right move but the conservative ""do nothing"" would have been far worse. Oh and Harper was the first to propose the carbon tax since its a right wing market mechanism. Its only insulting to conservatives because it was pulled off by the centrist libs. Can't make this shit up.

So yeah, bad energy deals, allowing China to sue us, limiting information, NAFTA 2.0, and putting taxpayers on the hook for corporate mistakes and allowing transport in dangerous waters to save time... Yeah... None of that has any impact on today.... We've only been shelling out for half of oil spill cleanups or more ever since. No impact on our taxes tho... But hey big corporate bonuses for fat cats... That must be good for taxpayers somehow right? Right?!

So unless you have ""free solitions"" to real problems its kind of a bad argument. How would cons fix the problems in healthcare without investment? Would they even have the political will to do so? Cons are now calling for government help for housing and other services that cost money. How can they both demand more spending and claim spending is too expensive? Housing, healthcare and homlessness have been a growing problem for a long time now. Neither the Cons nor the Libs have the political will to tackle it. Despite these are top problems for many Canadians right now.

Debt as a % has been reduced as our economy has grown. Thankfully employment and workforce participation is higher than ever. I wonder what negative impacts the cons will ascribe to that... Assrts and liabilities can co exist on the same financial sheet.

So if you want one sentence solutions to one sentence problems, be my guest, vote con. However in my experience life is complex and not everything is related 1:1. Anti Trudeau is not a political stance nor is it a policy. I vote for policies not ideology and certainly not because thats what my family voted. Silly people live in a simplistic black and white us vs them world. Cons are more susceptable imo because they only have one party. They cant see that ""the centrists and the left"" punish the libs by swinging their votes con or NDP or Bloc when they fuck up. Which they do. There is a reason they are in a minority position. No one is really happy with them but the cons fail to deliver policies or make good onntheir promises provincially or federally. In Qc cons are seen a sopressive and ar eunwelacome and have their own branch of right wing nationalism to boot.

Spent over 2bn on buck a beer lawsuits. Spent millions on a failed war room. Investing in vanity projects such as roads and bridges instead of housing or agriculture...

When indonesia or California have major crop losses from floods fires or fungus could that impact pricing?

What about unusual winter storms in the US damaging Texas where a huge protion of food imports are from?

Im not saying the tax is not impacting prices, as it surely is. It however is not the only cause of price increases. Big point being food costs are rising everywhere should be a hint. Seems to correlate strongly with desertification in most production regions... And correlates with migration from those regions... Weird.

Ive also predicted this for many years now as there has been a steady increase in food prices (my bill about doubled) in the years BEFORE this crisis began. The nerd i am likes to follow news on major regiinal crop losses and oh boy are their insurance premiums skyrocketing.

24 February 2023  


'Yet fears of another pandemic are quickly notching up.  
Cases of the H5N1 strain have already jumped from birds to mammals.  
It has sparked huge concern among top virologists that the deadly pathogen is now one step closer to spreading in humans — a hurdle which has so far stopped it from triggering a pandemic.  
Among those working on the models is Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist whose chilling projections of the Covid outbreak led the UK Government to impose the first lockdown.  
It comes as a dozen people in Cambodia are suspected of being infected with H5N1 in the same province where an 11-year-old girl died on Wednesday — raising fears the virus may even be spreading from human to human. '

'Most of these cases are probably caused by a mammal eating an infected bird, Jürgen Richt, who studies avian flu at Kansas State University, tells USA Today. But in a paper published in January in the journal Eurosurveillance, researchers document evidence that the virus might have spread between minks on a farm in Spain last October. **Genetic sequencing revealed a genetic change known to make some influenza viruses more capable of reproducing in mammals, writes Nature News’ Saima May Sidik.**  
  
**The mink outbreak “confirmed a fear that I had” that bird flu could spread efficiently in mammals, Thijs Kuiken, a veterinary pathologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, tells the Times.**  
  
**“We’ve never seen mammal-to-mammal transmission, ever. It has never happened,” Wille says to the Sydney Morning Herald. “Now it’s no longer just a hypothetical. Now we’ve actually seen it happen.”**  
  
Experts say this development is not a cause for alarm. “It’s not, in my mind, a particularly worrisome situation for human health,” Jim Lowe, a veterinarian at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, tells the Times. “Obviously it’s not very good for the mink.”  
  
The tightly packed, caged minks could have transmitted H5N1 due to their conditions rather than a fundamental change in the virus, Frank Wong, a bird flu expert at Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, tells the Sydney Morning Herald. “It’s still a bird-adapted virus.”  
  
But evidence of spread between mammals is also a warning sign, others say. “This outbreak signals the very real potential for the emergence of mammal-to-mammal transmission,” Wille told the CBC News’ Lauren Pelley in an email.  
  
“We need to be vigilant to make sure that spread in animals is contained,” Briand tells the AFP. “The more the virus circulates in animals, the higher is the risk for humans as well.”

Since late 2021, Europe has been gripped by its worst-ever outbreak of bird flu, with North and South America also experiencing severe outbreaks.  
This has led to the culling of tens of millions of domestic poultry worldwide, many with the H5N1 strain. The global outbreak is also responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of wild birds.  
Tom Peacock, a virologist at the Imperial College London, told AFP that it constitutes a ""panzootic"" – a pandemic among animals, in this case birds.  
""We are not fully sure why it's happening now but we think this might be driven by a slightly different strain of H5N1 which is spreading very effectively in wild, migratory birds,"" Peacock said.

'Paul Wigley, a professor of animal microbial ecosystems at the UK's Bristol University, said that while ""there is no transmission within mammalian populations, the risk to humans remains low"".  
Potential to cause pandemic?  
However two recent larger scale infections have raised concerns that bird flu has the potential to spread between mammals.  
One was an outbreak of H5N1 with the PB2 mutation at a Spanish farm in October that led to the culling of more than 50,000 minks.  
Research published in the journal Eurosurveillance last month said its findings ""indicate that an onward transmission of the virus to other minks may have taken place in the affected farm"".  
Transmission between the minks has not been confirmed, with further research ongoing.  
The mass death of some 2,500 endangered seals found along Russia's Caspian Sea coast last month has also raised concern.'

‘Incredibly concerning’: Bird flu outbreak at Spanish mink farm triggers pandemic fears  
Spread among captive mink could give the H5N1 strain opportunities to evolve and adapt to mammals  


24 JAN 2023 PMBYKAI KUPFERSCHMIDT

'When mink at a big farm in Galicia, a region in northwestern Spain, started to die in October 2022, veterinarians initially thought the culprit might be SARS-CoV-2, which has struck mink farms in several other countries. But lab tests soon revealed something scarier: a deadly avian influenza virus named H5N1. Authorities immediately placed workers on the farm under quarantine restrictions. The more than 50,000 mink at the facility were killed and their carcasses destroyed.

None of the farm workers became infected. But the episode, described in a paper in Eurosurveillance last week, has reignited long-smoldering fears that H5N1 could trigger a human pandemic. The virus is not known to spread well between mammals; people almost always catch it from infected birds, not one another. But now, H5N1 appears to have spread through a densely packed mammalian population and gained at least one mutation that favors mammal-to-mammal spread. Virologists warn that H5N1, now rampaging through birds around the world, could invade other mink farms and become still more transmissible.

“This is incredibly concerning,” says Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London. “This is a clear mechanism for an H5 pandemic to start.” Isabella Monne, a veterinary researcher at the European Union’s Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza in Italy, where the samples from Spain were sequenced, calls the finding “a warning bell.”

Preprint: First Mass Mortality of Marine Mammals Caused by Highly Pathogenic Influenza Virus (H5N1) in South America  


'Earlier this week, in Peru: SERNANP Reports At Least 585 Sea Lions &amp; 50,000 birds killed by Avian Flu. we learned of the large-scale die off of sea lions due to HPAI H5N1.  While this is not the first instance of H5N1 infecting marine mammals (see here, here, and here), it is the largest, and deadliest to date.   
We've seen other avian flu viruses infect and kill marine mammals, including H3N8 in New England (2011), H10N8 in Germany (2014), and H5N8 in the Baltic Sea (2017), but this outbreak comes on the heels of suspected mammal-to-mammal transmission of H5N1 in farmed mink, raising concerns this could be another example.   
Today researchers from Argentina and Peru have published a preprint on their investigation into this die off, where they state that mammal-to-mammal transmission of the virus cannot be ruled out. '

The top reasons talked about on the show:

* Climate change costs in the supply chain
* Energy costs (diseal fuel cost especially)
* Corporate profit increases
* War in Europe (Ukrain is responsible for feed 400M people)
* Avian Flu (for eggs and chicken)

 What isn't driving the cost:  Labour.

I will also add this article on cattle farmers thinning herds to near record lows due to drought:

50% of the irrigation from the Colorado river is used to grow cattle feed.   Right now the Lake Mead is at historic lows.  This is the lake made by the Hoover dam and is fed by the Colorado.  Las Vegas depends on Lake Mead for drinking water.

Licensing is important to keep track of where potential hot-spots are and to make sure all owners in the area are informed when there's an outbreak, as there's crucial prevention measures to be taken and signs of disease need to be reported to CFIA. It's a pretty much 100% fatal disease for domestic poultry and even the corpses of affected birds have to be disposed of under certain strict measures to prevent further environmental contamination/additional transmission to wild or domestic birds. This is likely why municipalities are getting stricter about chickens and/or requiring licensing/coop inspections. It's not about limiting personal freedom, it's a biosecurity issue. Avian influenza spreads SO fast and SO easily, you can't overlook even small outbreaks in domestic birds. Owners also need to be able to protect themselves if their birds start to seem sick, as animal/human transmission is rare but possible.  


As for grocery stores, first of all freedom of choice as a consumer isn't a legally-protected freedom, which is more what's implied when people talk about ""losing freedoms"". Second of all, it's not imposed by the government in any way. Although increased market concentration in the agrifood sector is a huge problem, and this is arguably due to policy choices that, although they haven't *mandated* a small market also haven't blocked consolidation, this is a very long-term trend that's been the responsibility of many governments (Lib and Con) over decades and has also been impacted by prevailing global policy trends, both food-specific and broader economic/financial policy that's caused concentration of the agrifood system across the globe, not just in Canada.

Licensing is important to keep track of where potential hot-spots are and to make sure all owners in the area are informed when there&amp;#39;s an outbreak, as there&amp;#39;s crucial prevention measures to be taken and signs of disease need to be reported to CFIA. It&amp;#39;s a pretty much 100% fatal disease for domestic poultry and even the corpses of affected birds have to be disposed of under certain strict measures to prevent further environmental contamination/additional transmission to wild or domestic birds. This is likely why municipalities are getting stricter about chickens and/or requiring licensing/coop inspections. It&amp;#39;s not about limiting personal freedom, it&amp;#39;s a biosecurity issue. Avian influenza spreads SO fast and SO easily, you can&amp;#39;t overlook even small outbreaks in domestic birds. Owners also need to be able to protect themselves if their birds start to seem sick, as animal/human transmission is rare but possible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for grocery stores, first of all freedom of choice as a consumer isn&amp;#39;t a legally-protected freedom, which is more what&amp;#39;s implied when people talk about &amp;quot;losing freedoms&amp;quot;. Second of all, it&amp;#39;s not imposed by the government in any way. Although increased market concentration in the agrifood sector is a huge problem, and this is arguably due to policy choices that, although they haven&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;mandated&lt;/em&gt; a small market also haven&amp;#39;t blocked consolidation, this is a very long-term trend that&amp;#39;s been the responsibility of many governments (Lib and Con) over decades and has also been impacted by prevailing global policy trends, both food-specific and broader economic/financial policy that&amp;#39;s caused concentration of the agrifood system across the globe, not just in Canada. Any government at this stage has limited power to quickly or unilaterally reimpose greater choice in the marketplace. However the current government has acknowledged the issues with Canada&amp;#39;s competition laws that fail to block too much consolidation and is starting a process to overhaul those laws for the modern age, which is something at least.&lt;/p&gt;

I say this because the risk of bird flu is already big and how fast and easily it can be spread would be very similar to covid-19 and certain varients. Before it was a declared it would have already been circulating - containing it would be futile. Prevention is key.

People feed wild birds from their hands,  people let their chickens run completely free while mixing with humans (think touristy farm ""experiences""), wild birds cannot be contained, and birds poop and fly every where. 

Even in 2022 with avion flu outbreaks in our region there were several backyard/small hobby farm bird owners who did NOT pay attention to any of the advisements from OMAFRA etc.

Just like it is common sense to wash your hands frequently, don't put your hands on your face, stay home if ill for covid/flu - the amount of people who didn't follow precautions pre- AND during Covid is dismal. Handwashing reminder signs in public washrooms are a health regulation for a reason.

The same applies to avion flu. There is reccommendations for bird owners (and the general public) and tracking by regulatory industries but if only the big poultry factories are following procedures it's going to spread fast. 


If a massive outbreak or pandemic occured with avion flu there would be many people who would not voluntarily euthanize their birds because they are beloved pets, a source of income, and a source of food. And how are you going to contain wild birds??

Meat has been almost entirely cut out other than as a treat night meal. 

Eating out is like 30x the price. Fast food is slow and unaffordable now. Certain grocery stores can be as much as like 400% increased prices on things. I don't know how the fuck people are surviving out there. The scary thing is it's not even just the economy, it's climate change-related too. Birds are dying en-masse to bird flu, and we're about to enter El Nino and very likely have horrible growing conditions in the west. Lots of lost crops already causing high prices on things like cabbage.

And making your own bread or food isn't the end-all be-all either. Eggs are expensive now, and without preservatives, homemade bread goes bad within 2 days. Eventually they will catch on, and start charging more on bulk items too. The expectation of convenience will be cut in the name of profit, and we'll be right back to where we were in the Depression, but somehow fucking worse?

With regard to bird feeders, the Government of Canada website states that:

“The use of bird feeders is unlikely to spread highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, and the risk of an outbreak in wild bird species that frequent feeders is considered low.” However, they also list some precautions.

https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/migratory-game-bird-hunting/avian-influenza-wild-birds.html

 

It’s also a good idea to sterilize feeders on a regular basis to prevent the spread of other pathogens such as mycoplasma conjunctivitis. Mark Read recommended an article at:

https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/ive-seen-a-sick-house-finch-with-red-swollen-or-weepy-eyes-whats-wrong-with-it/#

 

Sue Meech has provided some guidelines for precautions to take if handling geese:

Wear gloves. Avoid contact with body fluids.

Double bag

Wash hands carefully

Landfill disposal ok

 

Sue also forwarded an update that Public Works provided this afternoon (Feb 1st):

 

Geese in Lake Ontario Park

•          We received notification from Sandy Pines Wildlife Center and Councillor Osanic on the evening of Wen Jan 31, 2024, that there was a number of Dead and/or dying geese at Lake Ontario Park.

•          PW started receiving notification from residents of dead geese at Lake Ontario Park and by the bridge in elevator bay.   The first one came in yesterday afternoon.

•          PW staff along with Environment Staff met on site at Lake Ontario Park this morning.   There appeared to be approximately 20 dead geese washed up along the water way at Lake Ontario Park.  There are a number of other geese that are currently showing signs of distress.   Sandy Pines has sent people to pick up geese found in distress to be Euthanized at the Sandy Pines facility.

•          Brodie Richmond made contact with the MNR.   The MNR had been advised early this week of a few dead geese.   The MNR contacted the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC), who came and picked up the two carcases for testing.   It is expected the results of the testing will not be available for 2 weeks.

•          The CWHC did indicate that based on what they saw it would be consistent with Avian influenza, however this will not be confirmed until test results come back. 

•          PW is working with the personal safety information from CWHC and the City’s safety coordinator to develop a Job safety analysis, for PW staff handling the dead birds for disposal.

•          City staff are attending all other waterfront parks to determine if this outbreak is confined to Lake Ontario Park and Elevator Bay, or if it is more widespread.

•          It is expected that the number of geese infected will rise, and there will be many more death in a short period of time.  City staff will continue to check this area multiple times per day over the next week and clean up any additional dead geese found.

•          Brodie Richmond is currently working with Communications on this issue

•          PW will be removing the current dead birds this afternoon.

 

I also received a depressing report from Daphne Christie:

I was birding at Elevator Bay this afternoon and counted 60+ dead geese and saw two immature bald eagles feeding on one of the geese.

Several more dead geese in the Invista Lagoon along with Gadwalls and American Coots.

 

Many thanks to Christine, Daphne, Janet, Kathy, Kit, Lesley, Lisa, Mark, Mary, Shirley, and Sue for their emails, and my thanks and compliments to the City's Public Works Department for their speedy response to the situation.

Dear KFN Members:

I am passing on the news that there is an outbreak of Avian Influenza in the Kingston Area.

I had a message from Councillor Osanic who had heard from Sue Meech that there was Avian Influenza and dead geese at Lake Ontario Park.


I asked Sue Meech for more information, and she has informed me that:


Canadian Wildlife Health cooperative did confirm a case of Avian Influenza in Kingston a while ago. 


This outbreak seems to be the Highly Pathogenic type of AI. HPAI a much worse virus and we are sending bodies off for testing.


It's all over Kingston. Getting sick birds in from the area from Lake Ontario Park, Invista, Collins Bay, Bath. We are also getting calls from Belleville. 


The City is on this, sending out crews. 20 dead geese washed up on shore and many geese seen in distress this morning. Quick clean up essential to prevent cross contamination to predatory birds and canids. We've had 10 geese in the last 3 days alive but seizing. There are more dead than alive out there. This is alarming. There were so many geese overwintering in Kingston this winter there will be a large loss.


Unfortunately I don't think there's anything to do about it, except to warn people to be very careful if they are handling sick or dead geese.

If anybody knows about precautions or other actions to take, please let me know and I will pass them on.

Chris

If your exhausted by this talk then you can block me but if we end up where I think we are headed as a species then have fun reconciling the complete destruction of every thing and everyone you love Including the possibility of going go carting.


Call me a doomer if you want but the writing is on the wall. I am not right wing, not a conspiracy theorist, I have been looking at the science and I feel like the old man in soylent green who read those oceanic survey books. 

Everyday we edge closer and closer to environmental collapse, and I am not even talking about climate change alone, radiation leaks, chemical spills, hate crimes, war and war crimes, disastrous flooding which further contaminates water, covid, bird flu, people still litter like they don’t know better, homelessness rising more rapidly then we have seen in modern times, level of addition and overdosing at levels never seen before in modern times, lack of mental health support, societal pressures and more.

Dear KFN Members:

I am passing on the news that there is an outbreak of Avian Influenza in the Kingston Area.

I had a message from Councillor Osanic who had heard from Sue Meech that there was Avian Influenza and dead geese at Lake Ontario Park.


I asked Sue Meech for more information, and she has informed me that:


Canadian Wildlife Health cooperative did confirm a case of Avian Influenza in Kingston a while ago. 


This outbreak seems to be the Highly Pathogenic type of AI. HPAI a much worse virus and we are sending bodies off for testing.


It's all over Kingston. Getting sick birds in from the area from Lake Ontario Park, Invista, Collins Bay, Bath. We are also getting calls from Belleville. 


The City is on this, sending out crews. 20 dead geese washed up on shore and many geese seen in distress this morning. Quick clean up essential to prevent cross contamination to predatory birds and canids. We've had 10 geese in the last 3 days alive but seizing. There are more dead than alive out there. This is alarming. There were so many geese overwintering in Kingston this winter there will be a large loss.


Unfortunately I don't think there's anything to do about it, except to warn people to be very careful if they are handling sick or dead geese.

If anybody knows about precautions or other actions to take, please let me know and I will pass them on.

Here in Ontario were held to very strict standards on the raising of chicken. We get audited once a year to make sure our barns are clean, well managed and up to date. We keep stringent daily records on chicken health and wellness from barn temps, water and air quality.

The feed is inspected and we are proud to not use any hormones, by products just vitamins grain and some mild antibiotics if the birds get sick

We have lowered barn density allotments to allow more space for birds during grow out and also catch in much larger cages that have to be picked up and dropped off by a forklift, that means the birds are in much more comfort during and after grow-out.

Another thing is that our farm is run by my dad and I, hopefully my son when he's old enough but the benefits of supply management is a more owner operated business vs corporate farms.

Also we get set a price out the door, the supermarket price is not set, they often charge 8-12x the price

&gt;&gt;Symptoms of bird flu in humans

include:    
  
&gt;&gt;a very high temperature or feeling hot or shivery  
&gt;&gt;aching muscles  
&gt;&gt;headache  
&gt;&gt;a cough or shortness of breath

&gt;&gt;sickness  
&gt;&gt;stomach pain  
&gt;&gt;chest pain  
&gt;&gt;bleeding from the nose and gums  
&gt;&gt;conjunctivitis  
&gt;&gt;It usually takes 3 to 5 days for the first symptoms to appear after you've been infected.  
  
&gt;&gt;Within days of symptoms appearing, it's possible to develop more &gt;&gt;severe complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory &gt;&gt;distress syndrome.  
     
&gt;&gt;Getting treatment quickly, using antiviral medicine, may prevent &gt;&gt;complications and reduce the risk of developing severe illness.

There is too much to unpack in a simple Reddit comment but here are the key takeaways of why urban backyard chicken programs are an issue:  
\* Lack of Education: Chickens are not easy to care for. Our sanctuary has a 22-page Operations Manual. Everything from shelter, feeding, cleaning, safety, veterinary care, intake process, and euthanasia policies to emergency planning is included. We have 13 rescue chickens our chickens average an expense of $5300 per bird.  
\* [Lack of Veterinary Access:](https://www.secondhandstories.ca/post/veterinary-care-for-chickens) There are currently no Ottawa veterinarians who are accepting chicken patients. Anyone with chickens in an urban center would need to travel at least an hour to receive veterinary care, and even then, there are only a handful of vets who aren’t capable of meeting demand if a city-wide program were to launch. Only two years ago the Ontario Veterinary College closed service for birds. This is not a situation which is improving, it is only getting worse.  
\* Lack of Enforcement: Are you willing to up your taxes? Any new program that involves living beings requires a lot of investment. Essentially the city would have to launch a farmed animal shelter. Here are some considerations: What funding is being given to ensuring owners are educated? What budget exists to manage the rehoming or “retirement” of no longer wanted birds? What about when chickens are abandoned or disposed of in the wild - will bylaw be trained to collect them, and where will they be temporarily housed? Does the city have the funds to preemptively ensure violations are identified and that Chickens are not kept in negligent or abusive situations? How are chicken deaths being tracked? Where will funds come from for testing completed to ensure death is not attributed to avian flu? Will inspections be done to premises like “Rent a Chicken” to ensure animal health and welfare? Where is that budget?   
\* [Biosecurity / Zoonotic Risk:](https://www.secondhandstories.ca/post/avian-influenza) Anyone with chickens knows Avian Flu is a very real concern. There has been the culling of 7.2 million chickens in Canada because of recent HPAI outbreaks. There have been 849,000 birds impacted in Ontario alone.  Of 46 outbreaks over the past year in Ontario, 15 came from non-commercial premises. And last year when there was a case in Clarence Rockland it was only one month before there were 4 additional cases within a 50km radius in backyard flocks. It is also important to note, these numbers are only reported cases and due to the limitations of self-reported data it is possible this number is a conservative estimate - as it depends on how many people voluntarily give this information. Just earlier this spring, a companion dog died in Oshawa after being exposed to a goose which was infected with Avian Flu. And don’t get me started on salmonella. Ugh.  
\* Lack of Infrastructure for Contingencies: The Ottawa Humane Society does not have the resources or capacity to start accepting farmed animals. Additionally, there are only 3 remaining sanctuaries in the Ottawa area. As one of them, we’ve fielded thousands of rehoming requests in only one year. Thousands. There are multiple online groups trying to find homes for chickens they can no longer take care of.   
\* Roosters: Almost all municipalities which introduce backyard chickens ban roosters. But, unless a chick is what is called a “sex-link”, which produces different coloured male and female chicks, it is nearly impossible to confirm the sex of a chick. The rooster population which will be born will be killed if they cannot be placed.  
Who does this program benefit and does the benefit outweigh the risk to public safety and an animal's right to live without suffering?  I say this as a former urban city dweller with all due respect - y’all have no idea about chickens.

**Yes,** infection can come from a dead bird. **But, if I can offer any assurance** based on the information from experts, there's at least three variables that could've (likely would've) made it **unlikely for them to have been infected**. First, at this time, humans are mostly likely to be [infected by a poultry bird](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/flu-influenza/fact-sheet-guidance-on-precautions-handling-wild-birds.html) than any other, and those people [tend to work in a poultry environment](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/avian-influenza-h5n1/prevention-risks.html#a5) where things are highly contaminated.

Second, humans have to have ""sustained exposure"" in order for an infection to occur. Overall, it's still fairly [rare for humans to contract the virus](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/avian-influenza-h5n1/prevention-risks.html#a4) and if you get really sick from it, you tend to know something is wrong.

Third, all viruses have a window in which they're most contagious. If the kids came across the carcass much later than when the bird died, they were likely more at risk of bacteria from decomposition. You were 100% right to try to get them away from the bird, and reporting it was the right move. Even if it's not avian flu, if it looked kind of sketchy, there could've been something else going on that would also be helpful for an organization like the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, Health Canada, or a local rehab to know. Thankfully, if the kids seemed okay after the likely infection window, then they're probably just fine.

When it comes to the avian flu, **I understand the biggest issues as being that birds and other mammals are being infected at higher rates, and that viruses can mutate. We want to reduce the risk of both, hence the recent rounds of communications from health and safety experts in Canada.** My intention isn't to fear-monger here.

I don't doubt your attempt to keep the bill and cost down. You got some stuff on sale (I checked the flyer). I wonder if there was a scale/weighing issue. It might be useful to look over the receipt and just double check you didn't get overcharged. 

But ya, it's wild out there. You really have to lean into the austerity diet. There's an era of cheap cash and incredible buying power that is simply gone. I'd argue this is a new normal we haven't seen since the Great Depression. So, it's a very important time to be smart with your cash. 

I try to stick solely to on-sale items and shop between multiple stores. I saw that you wrote that this is a logistical problem for you - I'd try to put a little time and creative energy into addressing that with friends and family. Take advantage of more sale opportunities. Also, I cook a lot, I make preserves, and I freeze a lot of items (pasta sauces, chili, soups, stocks, cooked chicken, vegetables I don't want to go to waste). My chest freezer is full of sale meat and sale butter. I don't fuck around lol.

There are ways to slow the burning hole in one's pocket, but it's been tough.

\- Eggs are a pain in the ass. I try to buy them as cheap s possible, but they're very pricey these days. My hope is that we'll see a slight decrease, or at least a longer-run cap-off of egg prices. A lot of the weird issues with bird flu and chicken feed are been worked out, but the price seems to have run into other supply-chain constraints. So, I think $4 cartons are here to stay.

\- I leaned into eating WAY more onions, carrots and potatoes. They're typically very cheap and the prices are stable. The new normal is $6 bags for 10lb bags of onions and potatoes, but you can score them on sale for less at times. 

\- I hydrate my own beans from dry - there are real savings in that practice. I think I last calculated it's 5x cheaper pound-for-pound.

\- I don't pay for most fruit and veg unless it's less than $2/lb - so what fruit I buy varies a lot, and it's very sale-and-store dependent. Like, right now, Food Basics sells celery at $4, but Adonis is $2 (on sale for $1 this week!). Similarly, this week, Food Basics has .77/lb oranges, carrots and onions for $1. Last week, Basics had cheap pineapples, so I jumped on those. Those are really good prices, and I make sure I'm there to catch what I can of those.

\- I began making a lot more homemade stuff that we might have been 1000% more likely to buy pre-made. A sale-price mega bag of flour is, like, $15, and it goes a VERY long way.

\- I grow a lot of ""expensive"" greens and extras, like herbs, tomatoes, and peppers. I know it's not an option for everyone, but I saved a lot on produce this year thanks to this.

\- Lastly, I try to reduce all of my waste. I keep onion, carrot, and celery and similar scraps and ends in a freezer bag along with meat and fat trimmings. It's perfect for making soup stocks. It sounds like a small thing, but it adds up.

There is too much to unpack in a simple Reddit comment but here are the key takeaways of why urban backyard chicken programs are an issue:  
\* Lack of Education: Chickens are not easy to care for. Our sanctuary has a 22-page Operations Manual. Everything from shelter, feeding, cleaning, safety, veterinary care, intake process, and euthanasia policies to emergency planning is included. We have 13 rescue chickens our chickens average an expense of $5300 per bird.  
\* [Lack of Veterinary Access:](https://www.secondhandstories.ca/post/veterinary-care-for-chickens) There are currently no Ottawa veterinarians who are accepting chicken patients. Anyone with chickens in an urban center would need to travel at least an hour to receive veterinary care, and even then, there are only a handful of vets who aren’t capable of meeting demand if a city-wide program were to launch. Only two years ago the Ontario Veterinary College closed service for birds. This is not a situation which is improving, it is only getting worse.  
\* Lack of Enforcement: Are you willing to up your taxes? Any new program that involves living beings requires a lot of investment. Essentially the city would have to launch a farmed animal shelter. Here are some considerations: What funding is being given to ensuring owners are educated? What budget exists to manage the rehoming or “retirement” of no longer wanted birds? What about when chickens are abandoned or disposed of in the wild - will bylaw be trained to collect them, and where will they be temporarily housed? Does the city have the funds to preemptively ensure violations are identified and that Chickens are not kept in negligent or abusive situations? How are chicken deaths being tracked? Where will funds come from for testing completed to ensure death is not attributed to avian flu? Will inspections be done to premises like “Rent a Chicken” to ensure animal health and welfare? Where is that budget?   
\* [Biosecurity / Zoonotic Risk:](https://www.secondhandstories.ca/post/avian-influenza) Anyone with chickens knows Avian Flu is a very real concern. There has been the culling of 7.2 million chickens in Canada because of recent HPAI outbreaks. There have been 849,000 birds impacted in Ontario alone.  Of 46 outbreaks over the past year in Ontario, 15 came from non-commercial premises. And last year when there was a case in Clarence Rockland it was only one month before there were 4 additional cases within a 50km radius in backyard flocks. It is also important to note, these numbers are only reported cases and due to the limitations of self-reported data it is possible this number is a conservative estimate - as it depends on how many people voluntarily give this information. Just earlier this spring, a companion dog died in Oshawa after being exposed to a goose which was infected with Avian Flu. And don’t get me started on salmonella. Ugh.  
\* Lack of Infrastructure for Contingencies: The Ottawa Humane Society does not have the resources or capacity to start accepting farmed animals. Additionally, there are only 3 remaining sanctuaries in the Ottawa area. As one of them, we’ve fielded thousands of rehoming requests in only one year. Thousands. There are multiple online groups trying to find homes for chickens they can no longer take care of.   
\* Roosters: Almost all municipalities which introduce backyard chickens ban roosters. But, unless a chick is what is called a “sex-link”, which produces different coloured male and female chicks, it is nearly impossible to confirm the sex of a chick. The rooster population which will be born will be killed if they cannot be placed.  
Who does this program benefit and does the benefit outweigh the risk to public safety and an animal's right to live without suffering?  I say this as a former urban city dweller with all due respect - y’all have no idea about chickens.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staff was really nice but not so informed about the food;  it seemed like the owner inherited them from said casse croute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was owned by a half Chinese, half Thai man in his 30s, and very sadly went out of business around the time of the avian flu pandemic of the early 2000s; the owner told me that people would ask if he was Chinese, and when he answered honestly, they stopped coming. I can only hope that he eventually opened another restaurant, because he was a great cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

#They absolutely do. 

They're vectors of plenty of diseases and can definitely carry the current H5N1 avian flu strain. Other major diseases coming from pigeons include;

* Cryptococcosis
* Histoplasmosis

&amp;nbsp;

#Yes, the science understands it.

Pigeons use landmarks and other visual cues, and they also make use of _Magnetoreception_ which is an extra sense many animals have - like its name suggests, it is a sense that allows the animal to sense magnetic fields, it is basically a natural compass - other animals (mostly birds) have that sense


&amp;nbsp;

Agree on the iridescence - other than all the trouble they bring, I often find Pigeons beautiful to look at, but they always look goofy and awkward ahahaha _(and they're a nuisance more often than not!)_

However, others are correct - bird flu is circulating and you should take measures to protect yourself first. Wear a mask if you have one, get gloves and double bag the remains. If you want to do it without being swooped - as magpies will ""investigate"" a deceased flockmate and may think you're the reason they died if they see you handling the body - you can wait until nighttime when they head to the higher levels to sleep. Then go out with a mask, gloves, and your bags to dispose of the remains. 

Definitely call 311 as well so they are aware, although it's not abnormal for a bird to pass away of older age when the weather turns. In my years living downtown, there's always a small bump in dead birds during the first few temp drops, especially as we get closer to the -15/-30 range. But if you start to see more members of the flock acting sick, or if you have another one pass in your yard or adjacent yards, you may want to let 311 know. 

Also, and I say this with utmost kindness, if you're putting out food but not cleaning feeders or feeding spots with soap, hot water, and bleach then you should probably stop feeding altogether. Improperly cleaned feeders can increase the risk of virus transmission among wild birds, which will only lead to more of them getting sick and dying.

We use to be able to hide behind globalization by sourcing food from another country not hit by climate change but this is happening everywhere all at once. 

It’s scary because it WILL get worse. And it’s accelerating. 

You can extrapolate this too. How this might affect everyone beyond food. Higher inflation due to commodity prices result in higher cost of living. This leads to higher wage requirements. This causes price pressures to increase resulting in higher price growth for services and durable goods. The BOC wrote an article about how markets have not properly priced in the cost of climate change. At the time I scoffed. Now I understand.

The market peaked in March 2022, came down and bottomed out in January 2023, and is now increasing again. [Source](https://members.rebgv.org/news/REBGV-Stats-Pkg-Feb-2023.pdf).

They've been raising rates for 10 months now. If your friends can't afford their mortgage payments anymore then they over extended themselves. I bought in March 2022 (the very top of the market) with a variable rate mortgage. Yes it sucks, but I can still make my payments and save for retirement because I did the math and determined how high rates would have to go before I could no longer afford the payments. I have a lot of runway before we get there.

Side note: If your friends can't pay their mortgages, why are you hoping that they continue to raise rates? That's fucked up.

Everyone loves to point at the 80s for high interest rates, but if you [look at the actual rates](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-210-x/2010000/t098-eng.htm) it was only at 18% for less than a year. At the same time, bonds were yielding only slightly less, so if you were diversified like any good investor is, then the bond returns would mostly cancel out the high mortgage rates. Mortgage affordability was much different back then as well, so raising rates that high didn't have the same effect as it would today.

I see you've also fallen for the egg-argument, which is driven by the avian flu and is a completely unrelated to the overall economy. The annualised inflation rate for the last 8 months is 1.97% (see math below), which is exactly what the BoC is targeting and why they've paused interest rate hikes. With the recent failures of some US banks, it's likely that they will have to start stimulating the economy again and the likelihood of rate cuts (not hikes) is becoming a much more likely.

Annualised inflation math:  
Average [MoM inflation](https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/inflation-rate-mom) = (1.007+1.001+(1-0.003)+1.001+1.007+1.001+(1-0.006)+1.005) / 8 = 1.001625

You can look up various prices on the Ag Canada website and producer prices have been going up in the last year due to inflationary costs (feed, heat, housing, fuel, vet costs, etc) and avian flu - we've killed millions of birds in the last 10 months or so in Canada, and the US, because of that virus.

Retail prices have gone up more and kind of gone up and down, if you look at the 2022 monthly price summaries by province.

&lt;h2&gt;Prevention measures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself against avian influenza, the following prevention measures are recommended: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay up to date on all immunizations, especially the seasonal flu vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not touch sick or dead animals or their droppings and do not bring sick wild animals into your home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your pets away from sick or dead animals and their feces (poo).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report dead or sick birds or animals.&lt;br/&gt;

As some have pointed out, H5 is referring to bird influenza.  Influenza A and B are most common to seasonally infect humans, although there are also influenza C and D.


All influenza viruses are labeled as H#N#, for example:
- H1N1=swine flu
- H5N1=bird flu
   - There are many more combinations. 

So, of these numbers:
- H stands for hemagglutinin
   - Protien on viral surface that binds to human receptors allowing the virus to enter the cell.
   - There are 16 subtypes of hemagglutinin 
- N stands for neuraminidase
   - Protein that helps newly formed viruses budding from an infected host cell to leave.
   - Cleaves sialic acid so viruses don't clump together on host receptor proteins and helps the virus move through mucus, increasing infective range.


When a virus moves from an animal to a human, we call it a zoonotic event.  But moving from animals to humans doesn't mean it can go from human to human efficiently.   Viruses need to adapt to humans to be able to continually infect us.


So 2 different things happen with influenza:
- Genetic drift: Mutations slowly over time from infecting many people.
   - This is how one seasons flu can be just different enough from last seasons to reinfect you next year.
- Genetic Shift: A quicker, more drastic version of gene changes.
   - So, influenza is comprised of 8 single-stranded RNA gene segments that make up their genome.  However, they regularly pack a few more segments than needed and can go up to about 11.
      - So one virion could actually be missing an essential gene segment so even with the correct H and N cannot reproduce after entering your cell.
      - Another virion could have more than needed and make it easier to get the best combinations of gene segments. 
   - During genetic shift 2 seperate subtypes of influenza viruses infect the same cell at the same time and can swap gene segments creating radical shifts quickly in the new virus.
      - In influenza zoonotic events, this is particularly problematic as the animal virus and human virus can recombine to make something that has the ability to enter human cells well, and enough differences that our body doesn't immediately notice it and can bypass some of our defenses.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian scientist here.

As some have pointed out, H5 is referring to bird influenza.  Influenza A and B are most common to seasonally infect humans, although there are also influenza C and D.


All influenza viruses are labeled as H#N#, for example:
- H1N1=swine flu
- H5N1=bird flu
   - There are many more combinations. 

So, of these numbers:
- H stands for hemagglutinin
   - Protien on viral surface that binds to human receptors allowing the virus to enter the cell.
   - There are 16 subtypes of hemagglutinin 
- N stands for neuraminidase
   - Protein that helps newly formed viruses budding from an infected host cell to leave.
   - Cleaves sialic acid so viruses don't clump together on host receptor proteins and helps the virus move through mucus, increasing infective range.


When a virus moves from an animal to a human, we call it a zoonotic event.  But moving from animals to humans doesn't mean it can go from human to human efficiently.   Viruses need to adapt to humans to be able to continually infect us.


So 2 different things happen with influenza:
- Genetic drift: Mutations slowly over time from infecting many people.
   - This is how one seasons flu can be just different enough from last seasons to reinfect you next year.
- Genetic Shift: A quicker, more drastic version of gene changes.
   - So, influenza is comprised of 8 single-stranded RNA gene segments that make up their genome.  However, they regularly pack a few more segments than needed and can go up to about 11.
      - So one virion could actually be missing an essential gene segment so even with the correct H and N cannot reproduce after entering your cell.
      - Another virion could have more than needed and make it easier to get the best combinations of gene segments. 
   - During genetic shift 2 seperate subtypes of influenza viruses infect the same cell at the same time and can swap gene segments creating radical shifts quickly in the new virus.
      - In influenza zoonotic events, this is particularly problematic as the animal virus and human virus can recombine to make something that has the ability to enter human cells well, and enough differences that our body doesn't immediately notice it and can bypass some of our defenses.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian scientist here.

If the balcony is large enough and it hasn't been there for long it can safely be left that way and maybe the dumb bird will figure it out and fly off.

If it's a small balcony and the bird is exhausted, you can try grabbing it with a blanket and tossing it overboard. Don't grab the wings, try to either (gently) smother it with a blanket or scoop it by the belly (I used gloves.) It... will not like it either way.

Just be warned that if you do go for the grab the bird route, the whole neighbour of seagulls is going to take notice and start bombing you. All part of the fun.

And while both inflation and greed certainly play a part, I'm concerned that very few people seem to be making the link to some of the profound and fundamental issues around climate change and how it's starting to very much affect and threaten our food supply...

Just think for a second about how much of our produce comes from California for example, and what the effects of the major flooding there right now will be on prices for all that produce for at least the next couple months... 

Or the current crazy prices of poultry and eggs and how they relate to what's being referred to as the world's worst outbreak of avian flu, which is forcing the culling of millions of chickens and turkeys (not to mention threatening dozens of wild species - it has now reached isolated populations of endangered wild birds in places as remote as the *Galápagos Islands*). 

Or more locally, many Fraser valley farms are still struggling to recover and rebuild stock after all the damage from the flooding in November 2021.

There was drought throughout large portions of Europe last summer, which amongst other issues decimated the Italian tomato crops (which directly affects approximately 30% of the world's tomato sauce production)... another large portion of the world's tomato sauce supply was also cut due to last summers drought in California.

Even a staple food like rice has seen some significant production drops due to extreme weather events throughout China and South Asia (ie: the Pakistan floods) and even in California, reducing the supply of a staple food that millions depend on.

And of course the Russian invasion of Ukraine has drastically throttled food exports from what is traditionally a huge exporter of food to the world - particularly noted as one of the world's largest exporters of grains that are also a vital staple food for millions around the world.

*""Avian influenza A (bird flu) viruses may be transmitted from infected birds to other animals, and potentially to humans, in two main ways:*

*Directly from infected birds or from avian influenza A virus-contaminated environments.*

*Through an intermediate host, such as another animal.*

*Direct infection can occur from exposure to saliva, mucous, or feces from infected birds. Bird flu infections among people are [rare](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/reported-human-infections.htm); however, human infections can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled. People with close or prolonged unprotected contact (not wearing respiratory and eye protection) with infected birds or places that sick birds or their mucous, saliva, or feces have contaminated, might be at greater risk of bird flu virus infection.*

*Infection through an intermediate host is not as straightforward or as likely to occur, although it is possible. Influenza A viruses have eight separate gene segments. The segmented genome allows influenza A viruses from different species to mix genes (reassortment) and create a new virus if influenza A viruses from two different species infect the same person or animal at the same time.""*

It's likely they were infected due to faecal contact. 


*""Avian influenza A (bird flu) viruses may be transmitted from infected birds to other animals, and potentially to humans, in two main ways:*

*Directly from infected birds or from avian influenza A virus-contaminated environments.*

*Through an intermediate host, such as another animal.*

*Direct infection can occur from exposure to saliva, mucous, or feces from infected birds. Bird flu infections among people are [rare](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/reported-human-infections.htm); however, human infections can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled. People with close or prolonged unprotected contact (not wearing respiratory and eye protection) with infected birds or places that sick birds or their mucous, saliva, or feces have contaminated, might be at greater risk of bird flu virus infection.*

*Infection through an intermediate host is not as straightforward or as likely to occur, although it is possible. Influenza A viruses have eight separate gene segments. The segmented genome allows influenza A viruses from different species to mix genes (reassortment) and create a new virus if influenza A viruses from two different species infect the same person or animal at the same time.""*

&lt;li&gt;Chickens smell and require maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chickens are loud, even without a rooster around they are annoying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avian flu is absolutely a bigger risk and we don&amp;#39;t need more vectors of transmission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will create more of a headache for the city to enforce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will create an attractive nuance for coyotes, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctors notes for chickens should be ignored and mocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reginans should be able to enjoy their backyards without having to deal with their neighbours&amp;#39; animal husbandry taking place 5 feet away. It is completely reasonable to expect that livestock should be done elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

Bad and expensive policies being pushed into agriculture and trucking, diseases, fuel prices and shortages, and just the chaos from the supply chain breakdown during the covid lockdowns that never fully got resolved.... You can go and blame rich corporations and perhaps they do shoulder some of the blame, however a lot of them were also the ones that over filled warehouses full of goods in anticipation of shortages that kept goods on shelves while supplies were still having issues.

Things are not fixed and everything is breaking down. You can sit here try to argue it's not the case and some part of an article I linked to is wrong because reasons, but that doesn't fix your problem.

As for the north vs south question I do think it really depends on what you want. Cape Breton is gorgeous vistas, amazing hiking and camping, great food (prep to string your camping food up a tree tho, bears are no big deal if your hot dogs aren't in your tent but there are bears) cape Breton is fabulous and you can both easily loose a week there and easily make a stop in an area like parsoboro. If you've any rock interest I can't recommend beachcombing and the museum enough. If you want less nature and... I dont want to say more culture... but sorta more? Different anyways. Then south. Cute fishing villages and lighthouses. The bay of fundy tides are mindblowing to watch imo, lots of great food, valley is full of wineries and breweries and farm markets, keji is amazing camping if you can get in. Definitely still options all over for nature hikes. Eagle watching at sheffield mills might be back in operation by then (paused due to avian flu outbreak) 
So ya! Both options have tons of great things to do, places to see and food to eat, check out event listings for the time frame you're visiting in there's almost always a festival of some sort or the other somewhere in the summer.

""Is it safe to feed the birds?
There is always a risk of spreading disease when you feed birds or provide an artificial water source. Some illness, such as trichomonosis and conjunctivitis, are more likely to spread when birds come together. Because the risk is not from the food or water, it doesn’t matter what kind of feeder or bath you use. And it doesn’t matter if you spread seed on the ground, offer nut, suet, or seed in feeders, provide a pail to collect rainwater or have a bird bath. You can’t control the risk. Other illnesses result from rancid or moldy seed and contaminated water, and you have more control over this risk. Also, feeding birds has benefits to birds too, so it can be hard to know: Is it safe to feed the birds?

Here are some basics that make it safer to feed birds:

Watch and Clean
Keep an eye on the birds at your feeder, not just to see the various species, but also to notice if a bird looks unhealthy. It can be difficult to spot a sick bird, so it’s important to watch for birds that behave weirdly or look odd. Ask for help if you are not sure whether a bird is sick.
**Environment Canada recommends that backyard bird feeders and baths be cleaned regularly using a solution of 25 millilitres of household bleach (sodium hypochlorite, 5%-6%) and 2 litres of water – that’s one part bleach to 9 parts water. Feeders and baths must be well rinsed and dried before re-use.**

Trichomonosis
Trichomonosis is a parasite that is more prevalent in warm weather. According to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, trichomonosis spreads when food or water is contaminated with regurgitated saliva or droppings from an infected bird -- feeders and baths should be removed during outbreaks. Luckily, there is plenty of food and water available during warm months, so feeders are not really needed for birds to thrive. **NSBS recommends putting feeders out in the autumn after at least two frosts and removing them in the spring when the ground thaws.**

Avian Influenza
NSBS is seeing contradictory advice from various agencies located in regions where avian influenza presents a risk to birds. Environment Canada seems to have balanced the risks with the benefits, offering the following:
To minimize the risk of transmission of high-path avian influenza, do not handle or feed any wild bird by hand. Feeding encourages wild birds to congregate around food sources and can increase the probability of transmission among wild birds, both within and among species.
**The use of bird feeders is still safe, but they should be removed from areas that are open to poultry and other domestic animals. If you care for poultry, prevent contact between wild birds and poultry by removing exterior/outdoor sources of food, water and shelter that attract wild birds.**

&lt;li&gt;Big Grocery Store throws money at Little Store A, purchasing them for a price they can’t resist, after all the motive of capitalism is to make a profit right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big Grocery Store now buys Little Store B, same deal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are now no more little stores. All that remains is Big Grocery Store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big Grocery Store does this in more and more markets until they own big stores all across the country. Big Store A &amp;amp; B are the only competition, and they aren’t really, because they actively collude on price-fixing groceries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only ones hurt? The general public&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happened to SaveEasy, Atlantic Wholesalers, Zehrs and more on the list, I don’t care to do your own research for you because you’re just gonna discount my point anyway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root cause is the drive for record profit year after year, capitalism. The “free market” can’t be trusted to be free when there is only 3 companies doing the bidding &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government could absolutely step in and make our lives a little easier by mandating proper checks and balances for massive prices raises. Example? Chicken and eggs going up with the bird flu going around, one would say that’s pretty reasonable. But it can’t be used as an excuse to raise the prices tenfold either&lt;/p&gt;

We are fed percentages and per capita measures so often that people don't understand actual numbers anymore.  

There are three things going on: 

Inflation- ever notice that when a politician is looking to virtue signal around class they use actual profit numbers but when they talk about inflation is a percentage?  I'll do some (made up for example) quick #'s a grocery chain  does 500 million a year in 2019.  Their profit margin is 5%.  Meaning that 25 million is their profit.  If absolutely nothing else changes and inflation is net 20% over three years.  Their new revenue is 600 million and their profits are now 30 million.  And thats when you get the rabble rousers (who aren't stupid and know this)  bluster in parliament and on the news about greed.  

Regulatory changes- the cost of everything has gone up, and a big contributing factor taxes.  In particular carbon taxes, wheat for a loaf of bread for example:  Fertilizer-tractor-shipping-refining-shipping-baking-shipping-distribution-shipping-retail.  You don't think adding taxes on fuel is causing our food prices to go up? (On a personal note I'm not against it climate change is real and we need to do something) but that's not what we hear it's those same assholes screaming greed to promote class struggle because that's where they get their votes.

Environment- things like bird flu force culls which cause eggs to skyrocket which costs you more for eggs but also has a cascade effect on everything that uses eggs in their recipes.  

Actual greed- on the part of suppliers and on the chains this is what everyone is talking about like it's the main reason.  What can sobeys do if KD doubles in price? Is kraft getting greedy or was there a powdered cheese shortage? When you get to this point you almost have to look at individual products.

This isn't what you said though. You said 99% of landlords are taking advantage of people and charging ridiculous prices. So either 99% of the population in this province who own a rental property or have a basement apartment are bad people, or you're wrongly demonizing an entire demographic.

All landlord's aren't charging ridiculous prices. The ones that are charging less just get rented quickly leaving only the most expensive stuff when you check marketplace and kijiji and the like. I agree that there are many landlords charging too much and price gouging. It's just the blanket ""All landlords are evil"" nonsense that I take issue with.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you went to get groceries tomorrow and noticed that 99% of grocery store started charging $20 for a carton of eggs, would you just say ""This is fine, it's just the market rate""

Last year the price of eggs *did* skyrocket due to poultry deaths all over the world from the Avian Flu reducing supply. When I saw the prices I thought ""Wow, this bird flu stuff really sucks. We should probably be doing more about that."" And not ""Wow, Sobeys is an evil egg profiteer. How dare they raise prices in response to supply constraints""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Something needs to be done to get rental prices down (and the cost of living in general). Young people can't afford to survive nowadays. We are a G7 country! The fact that there are people who are working full time, yet genuinely can't afford to make ends meet is pathetic.

Completely agree. The situation in this country is ridiculous right now. We need to incentivize the construction of new housing and reduce the red tape and zoning laws that stop us from building higher density housing. On a federal level we need to reduce immigration as well imo, but that has less of an impact here since almost no one stays, lol. Doing anything to discourage people from investing in the market will objectively raise rental rates though. Not reduce them.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Alright, fair enough. However, the thing is, I'd imagine that the vast majority of landlords have built their house before 2019, therefore meaning the price of materials doubling doesn't affect them.

Every landlord with a mortgage is affected by raising rates though. Not to mention repairs, replacing appliances, etc. Plugging some numbers into a mortgage calculator, a 500k mortgage renewed in 2021 would see a monthly payment of \~$2100 at 2%, which was roughly what people were getting at the time (I have a friend who got like 1.6 near the bottom)

If they went variable, today's rate of 5.6% would see that same mortgage jump to \~3080. A **50% increase** equating to **$900/mo** in **2 years**. Starting to sound similar to rent raises isn't it? There's a causal factor here.

The same calculator on a $300k mortgage would be vs. $1850 vs. $1270. A 50%, $600/mo increase.

Given how hard the bank tried to get me to go variable when I bought in 2022, I would imagine a lot of people have seen massive increases like that. And even the ones who went fixed have to renew every 5 years.  

There are absolutely people ""exploiting this cost of living crisis to line their pockets"" as you put it, and you're right to be upset with them. But applying this to ""most landlords"" or ""99% of landlords"" is simply wrong, and people like you are attacking regular, good people, who made an investment to try and get ever so slightly ahead in this fucked up game we live in. Attacking them is ignorant and wrong, as is lumping them in with the slum lords.

The most annoying part of it all is that by investing in our market they're reducing rental rates by incentivizing more supply as I've explained elsewhere in this thread.

Just some bullet point responses for the moment:

* Disagree that Tyee pieces are fear based. I think their goal is to peel away the mainstream narrative, too, even if they land on sides that don't gel with others. In any case, similar to the experts you cited and how the media responds, Tyee platforms scientists that typically get ignored in mainstream media, too, ones I've followed for awhile now and generally agree with.
* Flu/cold have had a long time to evolve to what they are. Covid is still baby (possibly a lab leaked one, as we've talked about before). We really ought to group it with SARS1 (after all, it is SARS2, and it's no accident that they/media don't mention that term) rather than other coronaviruses, like the cold. Just because the playing field is level for continued spread of cold/flu/covid doesn't mean they'll all act the same way. We're also now seeing some disconcerting developments with avian flu (H5N1 specifically) hopping to mammals at unprecedented rates. That will be major cause for concern, even though many will find a way to minimize it. And on that note...
* A little fear can be healthy. It can spurn one into action. In the west, we're so obsessed with ""don't panic"" and minimizing shit. I'd suggest reading some articles on normalcy bias; presented with a threat, we tend to freeze/stay in a numb state. What this pandemic response has shown is we'll react the same way for (not too distant) future calamities and we're not ready for what might be coming, at all.
* Glad the nasal/mucosal vaccines developments are still happening. I imagine it's harder to get funding for development in that area these days, but hopefully that work continues. I've benefited from vaccines to date, but I want to see more long term options (variant-agnostic vaccines and indoor air quality improvements, in particular, and yeah, more studies on vitamin D and other vitamins). Bring it on! Vaccines were sold as a silver bullet (""vaccine in, mask off"", anyone?), but we always needed a layered approach and we will need more for other problems we as a society need to tackle. Also, as always, at least you're sharing studies to back your claims. Dr. F. makes random claims like ""long covid is no longer a big deal with omicron and vaccinations"" without citing any science whatsoever.
* Largely, we did used to stay home when sick, stay away from others, etc, I agree. Not sure what's going on now; seems like some stay home when they have flu/cold, but covid? No prob, let's go to work and spread that around. Maybe even cold/flu, too. There's a narrative of ""immunity debt"", so people's actions seem to suggest that they don't see spreading illness to others as a bad thing in an effort to help others play ""catchup"". It's truly sickening and anti-science. Noticing a LOT of hacking and NOT a lot of social distancing. I haven't been sick since mid-last year (covid infection in Jan, one of the nastiest colds of my life in May); guaranteed I'll stay home if there's a remote chance I'm sick and my circumstance with remote work/flex time allows that. (Not knocking folks who work in frontline positions who often don't have that option. Shouldn't be that way, but it's not their fault.)
* Moriarty lab is nipping at the heels of that mainstream narrative of hiding data/misleading the public. No method is perfect, but their purpose is a noble one. She's a whistleblower in her own way, but the work is speaking for itself. Given the time of year and the let 'er rip approach, plus waning immunity from vaccination (and yes, from infection to), I don't think ""severe"" is an unrealistic moniker for where we're at.

No, it's based on a dozen or more sources, based on both single turbines and larger farms. There's a small argument about low level noise affecting wildlife, but it's no different than other man made sources.

This isn't what you said though. You said 99% of landlords are taking advantage of people and charging ridiculous prices. So either 99% of the population in this province who own a rental property or have a basement apartment are bad people, or you're wrongly demonizing an entire demographic.

All landlord's aren't charging ridiculous prices. The ones that are charging less just get rented quickly leaving only the most expensive stuff when you check marketplace and kijiji and the like. I agree that there are many landlords charging too much and price gouging. It's just the blanket ""All landlords are evil"" nonsense that I take issue with.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you went to get groceries tomorrow and noticed that 99% of grocery store started charging $20 for a carton of eggs, would you just say ""This is fine, it's just the market rate""

Last year the price of eggs *did* skyrocket due to poultry deaths all over the world from the Avian Flu reducing supply. When I saw the prices I thought ""Wow, this bird flu stuff really sucks. We should probably be doing more about that."" And not ""Wow, Sobeys is an evil egg profiteer. How dare they raise prices in response to supply constraints""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Something needs to be done to get rental prices down (and the cost of living in general). Young people can't afford to survive nowadays. We are a G7 country! The fact that there are people who are working full time, yet genuinely can't afford to make ends meet is pathetic.

Completely agree. The situation in this country is ridiculous right now. We need to incentivize the construction of new housing and reduce the red tape and zoning laws that stop us from building higher density housing. On a federal level we need to reduce immigration as well imo, but that has less of an impact here since almost no one stays, lol. Doing anything to discourage people from investing in the market will objectively raise rental rates though. Not reduce them.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Alright, fair enough. However, the thing is, I'd imagine that the vast majority of landlords have built their house before 2019, therefore meaning the price of materials doubling doesn't affect them.

Every landlord with a mortgage is affected by raising rates though. Not to mention repairs, replacing appliances, etc. Plugging some numbers into a mortgage calculator, a 500k mortgage renewed in 2021 would see a monthly payment of \~$2100 at 2%, which was roughly what people were getting at the time (I have a friend who got like 1.6 near the bottom)

If they went variable, today's rate of 5.6% would see that same mortgage jump to \~3080. A **50% increase** equating to **$900/mo** in **2 years**. Starting to sound similar to rent raises isn't it? There's a causal factor here.

The same calculator on a $300k mortgage would be vs. $1850 vs. $1270. A 50%, $600/mo increase.

Given how hard the bank tried to get me to go variable when I bought in 2022, I would imagine a lot of people have seen massive increases like that. And even the ones who went fixed have to renew every 5 years.  

There are absolutely people ""exploiting this cost of living crisis to line their pockets"" as you put it, and you're right to be upset with them. But applying this to ""most landlords"" or ""99% of landlords"" is simply wrong, and people like you are attacking regular, good people, who made an investment to try and get ever so slightly ahead in this fucked up game we live in. Attacking them is ignorant and wrong, as is lumping them in with the slum lords.

The most annoying part of it all is that by investing in our market they're reducing rental rates by incentivizing more supply as I've explained elsewhere in this thread. They're literally helping the situation ever so slightly while ignorant teenagers and 20 somethings flame them all day and do nothing to make anything any better.

I agree that there are many landlords charging too much and price gouging. It&amp;#39;s just the blanket &amp;quot;All landlords are evil&amp;quot; nonsense that I take issue with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you went to get groceries tomorrow and noticed that 99% of grocery store started charging $20 for a carton of eggs, would you just say &amp;quot;This is fine, it&amp;#39;s just the market rate&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year the price of eggs &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; skyrocket due to poultry deaths all over the world from the Avian Flu reducing supply. When I saw the prices I thought &amp;quot;Wow, this bird flu stuff really sucks. We should probably be doing more about that.&amp;quot; And not &amp;quot;Wow, Sobeys is an evil egg profiteer. How dare they raise prices in response to supply constraints&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something needs to be done to get rental prices down (and the cost of living in general). Young people can&amp;#39;t afford to survive nowadays. We are a G7 country! The fact that there are people who are working full time, yet genuinely can&amp;#39;t afford to make ends meet is pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completely agree. The situation in this country is ridiculous right now. We need to incentivize the construction of new housing and reduce the red tape and zoning laws that stop us from building higher density housing. On a federal level we need to reduce immigration as well imo, but that has less of an impact here since almost no one stays, lol. Doing anything to discourage people from investing in the market will objectively raise rental rates though. Not reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, fair enough. However, the thing is, I&amp;#39;d imagine that the vast majority of landlords have built their house before 2019, therefore meaning the price of materials doubling doesn&amp;#39;t affect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every landlord with a mortgage is affected by raising rates though. Not to mention repairs, replacing appliances, etc. Plugging some numbers into a mortgage calculator, a 500k mortgage renewed in 2021 would see a monthly payment of ~$2100 at 2%, which was roughly what people were getting at the time (I have a friend who got like 1.6 near the bottom)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they went variable, today&amp;#39;s rate of 5.6% would see that same mortgage jump to ~3080. A &lt;strong&gt;50% increase&lt;/strong&gt; equating to &lt;strong&gt;$900/mo&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;2 years&lt;/strong&gt;. Starting to sound similar to rent raises isn&amp;#39;t it? There&amp;#39;s a causal factor here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same calculator on a $300k mortgage would be vs. $1850 vs. $1270. A 50%, $600/mo increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how hard the bank tried to get me to go variable when I bought in 2022, I would imagine a lot of people have seen massive increases like that. And even the ones who went fixed have to renew every 5 years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are absolutely people &amp;quot;exploiting this cost of living crisis to line their pockets&amp;quot; as you put it, and you&amp;#39;re right to be upset with them. But applying this to &amp;quot;most landlords&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;99% of landlords&amp;quot; is simply wrong, and people like you are attacking regular, good people, who made an investment to try and get ever so slightly ahead in this fucked up game we live in. Attacking them is ignorant and wrong, as is lumping them in with the slum lords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most annoying part of it all is that by investing in our market they&amp;#39;re reducing rental rates by incentivizing more supply as I&amp;#39;ve explained elsewhere in this thread. They&amp;#39;re literally helping the situation ever so slightly while ignorant teenagers and 20 somethings flame them all day and do nothing to make anything any better. I&amp;#39;m seeing this childish &amp;quot;All landlords are price gouging pieces of shit&amp;quot; nonsense all over social media and it&amp;#39;s tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

 Fauci and Collins funded the gain of function research on H5N1, just as they did on sars cov2. They mutated it and infected ferrets until they knew it was transmissible to humans back in 2013, then shut the program down citing safety after they reached their goal. &lt;/p&gt;

Another lock down will be enforced in some areas because of civil unrest, bird flu or whatever else can be blamed...

All driving forward until the Liberal adgenda is so set in place it's impossible to undo. 


If all you do is look at each Bill amendment each event, each happening, around the country, and the world, you think meh, no big deal.

All they seem to be is intent on driving this country down. They say it's all for the betterment of Canada but again, take a step back and look at everything as a whole. Look at the interconnectedness of all the changes they are implementing.

Rabies has only had 28 cases in a hundred years (yes, all fatal) and apparently this really is the first bird flu transmission to humans in Canada, and according to Google, less than a thousand total cases in the world since we discovered the disease in the 90&amp;#39;s. Wildly low numbers compared to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

First, it caused a panzootic in birds. Then it jumped to marine mammals and killed them en masse. Then it jumped to cows and has been causing massive infections in dairy herds. Last week, it was announced it was found in pigs (which scientists had previously said would be extremely alarming). Now we have a teenager in critical condition with it.

To be clear: it has NOT gone human-to-human yet. But the issue is that a reassortment event is now increasingly likely, much more so than it has been at any other point in time. The upcoming flu season will give it additional reassortment opportunities.

If it goes human-to-human, there possibility for fuckery is off the richter for three reasons. First, based on historical animal-to-human cases and ferret studies, it could have an IFR an order of magnitude higher than COVID. In an immunologically naive population, COVID had a fatality rate of about 0.5% - estimates for bird flu range from 10% to even 40-50%. Second, whereas COVID mainly killed elderly people, H5N1 kills young people (see: this case in critical condition as an example). 

Third, because we just finished a pandemic, if this shit blows up, there will be *zero* public or policymaker appetite for trying to slow it down (at least initially) - the public is totally over pandemic control measures. I expect that if it maintains a high fatality rate and if it's age stratified towards kids/teens like COVID was towards elderly, those attitudes will change in relatively short order - but it might take a couple months, at which point it'll be too late.

The only saving grace is that it may have a much lower R0 (spread rate) than COVID, which would help to blunt its effect.

I think a big one is all the boomers who are retiring/have been retiring over the last several years without pensions or strong retirement savings. CPP, OAS, and the GIS don't give you a lot to retire on. This is all due to a mix of the actions of Conservative and Liberal politicians over the past 40 to 60 years. The way to fix this is to increase seniors benefits. The problem is who wants to pay for it? Or what programs do you want to lose to pay for it? 


High food prices seem to be due to a mix of Covid, climate change, disease, and war.

&lt;p&gt;I think a big one is all the boomers who are retiring/have been retiring over the last several years without pensions or strong retirement savings. CPP, OAS, and the GIS don&amp;#39;t give you a lot to retire on. This is all due to a mix of the actions of Conservative and Liberal politicians over the past 40 to 60 years. The way to fix this is to increase seniors benefits. The problem is who wants to pay for it? Or what programs do you want to lose to pay for it? &lt;/p&gt;

However, others are correct - bird flu is circulating and you should take measures to protect yourself first. Wear a mask if you have one, get gloves and double bag the remains. If you want to do it without being swooped - as magpies will ""investigate"" a deceased flockmate and may think you're the reason they died if they see you handling the body - you can wait until nighttime when they head to the higher levels to sleep. Then go out with a mask, gloves, and your bags to dispose of the remains. 

Definitely call 311 as well so they are aware, although it's not abnormal for a bird to pass away of older age when the weather turns. In my years living downtown, there's always a small bump in dead birds during the first few temp drops, especially as we get closer to the -15/-30 range. But if you start to see more members of the flock acting sick, or if you have another one pass in your yard or adjacent yards, you may want to let 311 know. 

Also, and I say this with utmost kindness, if you're putting out food but not cleaning feeders or feeding spots with soap, hot water, and bleach then you should probably stop feeding altogether. Improperly cleaned feeders can increase the risk of virus transmission among wild birds, which will only lead to more of them getting sick and dying. This also puts you, an immunocompromised person, at great risk of catching something as well. It's not worth it, especially with bird flu already present in AB.

But if you start to see more members of the flock acting sick, or if you have another one pass in your yard or adjacent yards, you may want to let 311 know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, and I say this with utmost kindness, if you&amp;#39;re putting out food but not cleaning feeders or feeding spots with soap, hot water, and bleach then you should probably stop feeding altogether. Improperly cleaned feeders can increase the risk of virus transmission among wild birds, which will only lead to more of them getting sick and dying. This also puts you, an immunocompromised person, at great risk of catching something as well. It&amp;#39;s not worth it, especially with bird flu already present in AB. There&amp;#39;s already a human case in BC, and last I saw &lt;a href=""https://globalnews.ca/news/10863715/bird-flu-canada-human-case-bc/""&gt;that person was not doing well.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;Prevention measures
---------------------
To protect yourself against avian influenza, the following prevention measures are recommended: 

- **Stay up to date on all immunizations, especially the seasonal flu vaccine**.  
- Do not touch sick or dead animals or their droppings and do not bring sick wild animals into your home.  
- Keep your pets away from sick or dead animals and their feces (poo).  
- Report dead or sick birds or animals.  
--For poultry or livestock, contact the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Animal Health office:   https://inspection.canada.ca/en/about-cfia/contact-cfia-office-telephone#bc-animal. 
-- For pets, contact your veterinarian or call the BC Animal Health Centre at 1 800 661-9903. 
-- For wild birds, contact the BC Wild Bird Mortality Line: 1 866 431-2473. 
-- For wild mammals, contact the BC Wildlife Health Program: 1 250 751-7246. 

&gt;If you have been exposed to sick or dead birds or animals or work on farm where avian influenza has been detected, watch for symptoms of influenza-like illness (see link below for more details). If you get symptoms within 10 days after exposure to sick or dead animals, tell your health-care provider that you have been in contact with sick animals and are concerned about avian influenza.

As some have pointed out, H5 is referring to bird influenza.  Influenza A and B are most common to seasonally infect humans, although there are also influenza C and D.


All influenza viruses are labeled as H#N#, for example:
- H1N1=swine flu
- H5N1=bird flu
   - There are many more combinations. 

So, of these numbers:
- H stands for hemagglutinin
   - Protien on viral surface that binds to human receptors allowing the virus to enter the cell.
   - There are 16 subtypes of hemagglutinin 
- N stands for neuraminidase
   - Protein that helps newly formed viruses budding from an infected host cell to leave.
   - Cleaves sialic acid so viruses don't clump together on host receptor proteins and helps the virus move through mucus, increasing infective range.


When a virus moves from an animal to a human, we call it a zoonotic event.  But moving from animals to humans doesn't mean it can go from human to human efficiently.   Viruses need to adapt to humans to be able to continually infect us.


So 2 different things happen with influenza:
- Genetic drift: Mutations slowly over time from infecting many people.
   - This is how one seasons flu can be just different enough from last seasons to reinfect you next year.
- Genetic Shift: A quicker, more drastic version of gene changes.
   - So, influenza is comprised of 8 single-stranded RNA gene segments that make up their genome.  However, they regularly pack a few more segments than needed and can go up to about 11.
      - So one virion could actually be missing an essential gene segment so even with the correct H and N cannot reproduce after entering your cell.
      - Another virion could have more than needed and make it easier to get the best combinations of gene segments. 
   - During genetic shift 2 seperate subtypes of influenza viruses infect the same cell at the same time and can swap gene segments creating radical shifts quickly in the new virus.

As some have pointed out, H5 is referring to bird influenza.  Influenza A and B are most common to seasonally infect humans, although there are also influenza C and D.


All influenza viruses are labeled as H#N#, for example:
- H1N1=swine flu
- H5N1=bird flu
   - There are many more combinations. 

So, of these numbers:
- H stands for hemagglutinin
   - Protien on viral surface that binds to human receptors allowing the virus to enter the cell.
   - There are 16 subtypes of hemagglutinin 
- N stands for neuraminidase
   - Protein that helps newly formed viruses budding from an infected host cell to leave.
   - Cleaves sialic acid so viruses don't clump together on host receptor proteins and helps the virus move through mucus, increasing infective range.


When a virus moves from an animal to a human, we call it a zoonotic event.  But moving from animals to humans doesn't mean it can go from human to human efficiently.   Viruses need to adapt to humans to be able to continually infect us.


So 2 different things happen with influenza:
- Genetic drift: Mutations slowly over time from infecting many people.
   - This is how one seasons flu can be just different enough from last seasons to reinfect you next year.
- Genetic Shift: A quicker, more drastic version of gene changes.
   - So, influenza is comprised of 8 single-stranded RNA gene segments that make up their genome.  However, they regularly pack a few more segments than needed and can go up to about 11.
      - So one virion could actually be missing an essential gene segment so even with the correct H and N cannot reproduce after entering your cell.
      - Another virion could have more than needed and make it easier to get the best combinations of gene segments. 
   - During genetic shift 2 seperate subtypes of influenza viruses infect the same cell at the same time and can swap gene segments creating radical shifts quickly in the new virus.
      - In influenza zoonotic events, this is particularly problematic as the animal virus and human virus can recombine to make something that has the ability to enter human cells well, and enough differences that our body doesn't immediately notice it and can bypass some of our defenses.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian scientist here.

Why aren't bylaws heeded? Well, they are bylaws, and hence they differ based upon the municipality (Vancouver started prohibiting this in 2022, Coquitlam in 2012, Burnaby never), fairly recent in the grand scheme of things, difficult to keep track of, easy to ignore (ever see a dog off leash?). I grew up feeding birds in the suburbs, so it's a bit foreign to me too.

2. Glad we can agree on that

3. Roads and powerlines are necessary, and provide benefits to citizens, not a nova scotian billionaire.

But the argument is about esthetics. If you don't like how a turbine looks, then why are roads and powerlines ok? And if there is excess energy generated by these turbines, it's likely to be sold at a competitive rate like what's happening in New Brunswick.

4. Thats the first result you found on Google and that's for a single turbine, not one of the world's largest wind farms. 

No, it's based on a dozen or more sources, based on both single turbines and larger farms. There's a small argument about low level noise affecting wildlife, but it's no different than other man made sources.

5. wind turbines kill on average 1 bird a month. With GH2s proposed 730 turbines that's over 700 birds a month, and birds aren't even the biggest loss. Bats are. 

Even with scaling compared to single turbines and smaller farms, it's still lower ranking than other sources of bird death. It'd make more sense to invest in helping against the bird flu, if you're that worried.

Over the next three days, she developed a cough and diarrhea and began vomiting. She was taken back to the ER on Nov. 7 in respiratory distress and with a condition called hemodynamic instability, in which her body was unable to maintain consistent blood flow and pressure. She was admitted to the hospital.

As the disease progressed over the next few days, she was intubated and put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) — a life support technique that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs for patients with severe heart or lung conditions.

Because of concerns about the potential for a cytokine storm — a potentially lethal condition in which the body releases too many inflammatory molecules — she was put on a daily regimen of plasma exchange therapy, in which the patient’s plasma is removed in exchange for donated, health plasma.

As the days went by, her viral load began to decrease; on Nov. 16, eight days after she’d been admitted, she tested negative for the virus.

The authors of the report noted, however, that the viral load remained consistently higher in her lower lungs than in her upper respiratory tract — suggesting that the disease may manifest in places not currently tested for it (like the lower lungs) even as it disappears from those that are tested (like the mouth and nose).


She fully recovered and was discharged sometime after Nov. 28, when her intubation tube was removed.

Irrespective of where and when they occurred, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University in Providence, R.I., “it is worrisome because it indicates that the virus can change in a person and possibly cause a greater severity of symptoms than initial infection.”

The U.S. reported its first severe human case of bird flu on Wednesday in a Louisiana resident who is hospitalized in critical condition, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.

California, the country's most populous state, declared an emergency later Wednesday as the H5N1 virus spreads more widely in dairy herds. Data has shown 649 herds have tested positive since late August — roughly 60 per cent of the state total.

Partial viral genome data of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that infected the patient in Louisiana indicates the virus belongs to a genotype related to viruses recently detected in wild birds and poultry in the U.S. and in recent human cases in British Columbia and Washington state.

The D1.1 genotype of the virus differs from the one detected in dairy cows in the U.S. as well as human cases in multiple states and some poultry outbreaks in the country, the CDC said.

Bird flu has infected more than 860 dairy herds in 16 states since March and killed 123 million poultry since the outbreak began in 2022.

&lt;p&gt;As the disease progressed over the next few days, she was intubated and put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) — a life support technique that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs for patients with severe heart or lung conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of concerns about the potential for a cytokine storm — a potentially lethal condition in which the body releases too many inflammatory molecules — she was put on a daily regimen of plasma exchange therapy, in which the patient’s plasma is removed in exchange for donated, health plasma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the days went by, her viral load began to decrease; on Nov. 16, eight days after she’d been admitted, she tested negative for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of the report noted, however, that the viral load remained consistently higher in her lower lungs than in her upper respiratory tract — suggesting that the disease may manifest in places not currently tested for it (like the lower lungs) even as it disappears from those that are tested (like the mouth and nose).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She fully recovered and was discharged sometime after Nov. 28, when her intubation tube was removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of where and when they occurred, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University in Providence, R.I., “it is worrisome because it indicates that the virus can change in a person and possibly cause a greater severity of symptoms than initial infection.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. reported its first severe human case of bird flu on Wednesday in a Louisiana resident who is hospitalized in critical condition, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California, the country&amp;#39;s most populous state, declared an emergency later Wednesday as the H5N1 virus spreads more widely in dairy herds. Data has shown 649 herds have tested positive since late August — roughly 60 per cent of the state total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partial viral genome data of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that infected the patient in Louisiana indicates the virus belongs to a genotype related to viruses recently detected in wild birds and poultry in the U.S. and in recent human cases in British Columbia and Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The D1.1 genotype of the virus differs from the one detected in dairy cows in the U.S. as well as human cases in multiple states and some poultry outbreaks in the country, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bird flu has infected more than 860 dairy herds in 16 states since March and killed 123 million poultry since the outbreak began in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh man, I am so ready for a different pandemic!!!&lt;/p&gt;

Over the next three days, she developed a cough and diarrhea and began vomiting. She was taken back to the ER on Nov. 7 in respiratory distress and with a condition called hemodynamic instability, in which her body was unable to maintain consistent blood flow and pressure. She was admitted to the hospital.

As the disease progressed over the next few days, she was intubated and put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) — a life support technique that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs for patients with severe heart or lung conditions.

Because of concerns about the potential for a cytokine storm — a potentially lethal condition in which the body releases too many inflammatory molecules — she was put on a daily regimen of plasma exchange therapy, in which the patient’s plasma is removed in exchange for donated, health plasma.

As the days went by, her viral load began to decrease; on Nov. 16, eight days after she’d been admitted, she tested negative for the virus.

The authors of the report noted, however, that the viral load remained consistently higher in her lower lungs than in her upper respiratory tract — suggesting that the disease may manifest in places not currently tested for it (like the lower lungs) even as it disappears from those that are tested (like the mouth and nose).


She fully recovered and was discharged sometime after Nov. 28, when her intubation tube was removed.

Irrespective of where and when they occurred, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University in Providence, R.I., “it is worrisome because it indicates that the virus can change in a person and possibly cause a greater severity of symptoms than initial infection.”

Posted: Dec 18, 2024 11:58 AM EST | Last Updated: December 18, 2024

The U.S. reported its first severe human case of bird flu on Wednesday in a Louisiana resident who is hospitalized in critical condition, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.

California, the country's most populous state, declared an emergency later Wednesday as the H5N1 virus spreads more widely in dairy herds. Data has shown 649 herds have tested positive since late August — roughly 60 per cent of the state total.

Partial viral genome data of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that infected the patient in Louisiana indicates the virus belongs to a genotype related to viruses recently detected in wild birds and poultry in the U.S. and in recent human cases in British Columbia and Washington state.

The D1.1 genotype of the virus differs from the one detected in dairy cows in the U.S. as well as human cases in multiple states and some poultry outbreaks in the country, the CDC said.

Bird flu has infected more than 860 dairy herds in 16 states since March and killed 123 million poultry since the outbreak began in 2022.

First, it caused a panzootic in birds. Then it jumped to marine mammals and killed them en masse. Then it jumped to cows and has been causing massive infections in dairy herds. Last week, it was announced it was found in pigs (which scientists had previously said would be extremely alarming). Now we have a teenager in critical condition with it.

To be clear: it has NOT gone human-to-human yet. But the issue is that a reassortment event is now increasingly likely, much more so than it has been at any other point in time. The upcoming flu season will give it additional reassortment opportunities.

If it goes human-to-human, there possibility for fuckery is off the richter for three reasons. First, based on historical animal-to-human cases and ferret studies, it could have an IFR an order of magnitude higher than COVID. In an immunologically naive population, COVID had a fatality rate of about 0.5% - estimates for bird flu range from 10% to even 40-50%. Second, whereas COVID mainly killed elderly people, H5N1 kills young people (see: this case in critical condition as an example). 

Third, because we just finished a pandemic, if this shit blows up, there will be *zero* public or policymaker appetite for trying to slow it down (at least initially) - the public is totally over pandemic control measures. I expect that if it maintains a high fatality rate and if it's age stratified towards kids/teens like COVID was towards elderly, those attitudes will change in relatively short order - but it might take a couple months, at which point it'll be too late.

The only saving grace is that it may have a much lower R0 (spread rate) than COVID, which would help to blunt its effect.

I think a big one is all the boomers who are retiring/have been retiring over the last several years without pensions or strong retirement savings. CPP, OAS, and the GIS don't give you a lot to retire on. This is all due to a mix of the actions of Conservative and Liberal politicians over the past 40 to 60 years. The way to fix this is to increase seniors benefits. The problem is who wants to pay for it? Or what programs do you want to lose to pay for it? 


High food prices seem to be due to a mix of Covid, climate change, disease, and war. I know that Loblaws is a popular target, but take a look at what's been happening at the producer level.  The Canadian cattle herd peaked in 2004 and has been falling ever since due to a series of droughts and lack of feed. The same is true for US beef cattle with their herd at 1960s levels. That translates into high need prices for consumers. https://www.canadiancattlemen.ca/livestock/beef-cattle/canada-u-s-cattle-inventories-further-decline/
Have you bought olive oil recently? It's gotten massively more expensive in the last two years. This article says 61% higher. I'd argue it's closer to 250% as I think the Bertolini olive oil I bought at Costco has gone from $19 for 3 liters to $48. Again, drought is the cause. https://nationalpost.com/life/food/giving-new-meaning-to-liquid-gold-why-olive-oil-prices-have-surged

This article covers an assortment of weather related woes hitting the food industry. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7292120",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trudeau&amp;#39;s easy to blame for this, but I&amp;#39;d argue that there are a lot of other factors and actors to blame this on beyond Trudeau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a big one is all the boomers who are retiring/have been retiring over the last several years without pensions or strong retirement savings. CPP, OAS, and the GIS don&amp;#39;t give you a lot to retire on. This is all due to a mix of the actions of Conservative and Liberal politicians over the past 40 to 60 years. The way to fix this is to increase seniors benefits. The problem is who wants to pay for it? Or what programs do you want to lose to pay for it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High food prices seem to be due to a mix of Covid, climate change, disease, and war. I know that Loblaws is a popular target, but take a look at what&amp;#39;s been happening at the producer level.  The Canadian cattle herd peaked in 2004 and has been falling ever since due to a series of droughts and lack of feed. The same is true for US beef cattle with their herd at 1960s levels. That translates into high need prices for consumers. &lt;a href=""https://www.canadiancattlemen.ca/livestock/beef-cattle/canada-u-s-cattle-inventories-further-decline/""&gt;https://www.canadiancattlemen.ca/livestock/beef-cattle/canada-u-s-cattle-inventories-further-decline/&lt;/a&gt;
Have you bought olive oil recently? It&amp;#39;s gotten massively more expensive in the last two years. This article says 61% higher. I&amp;#39;d argue it&amp;#39;s closer to 250% as I think the Bertolini olive oil I bought at Costco has gone from $19 for 3 liters to $48. Again, drought is the cause. &lt;a href=""https://nationalpost.com/life/food/giving-new-meaning-to-liquid-gold-why-olive-oil-prices-have-surged""&gt;https://nationalpost.com/life/food/giving-new-meaning-to-liquid-gold-why-olive-oil-prices-have-surged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'A week after the first reports of H5N1 being detected in a pig in the United States (see USDA: APHIS Reports 1st Detection of HPAI H5N1 in Swine (Oregon)) the USDA has confirmed that a second pig on the premises has tested positive for the HPAI H5 virus.   
While this appears to be a limited outbreak on a small, non-commercial farm, this is also the 4th livestock species - joining goats, alpacas, and dairy cattle - to be infected in the United States in the past 7 months.   
This outbreak - like the large poultry outbreak in neighboring Washington state (with &gt; 1 dozen associated human infections) - comes from the introduction of a new genotype of the virus (D1.1 in Washington State and D1.2 in Oregon) this fall.     
Since its arrival in late 2021, more than 100 genotypes have been detected in the United States alone.

However, others are correct - bird flu is circulating and you should take measures to protect yourself first. Wear a mask if you have one, get gloves and double bag the remains. If you want to do it without being swooped - as magpies will ""investigate"" a deceased flockmate and may think you're the reason they died if they see you handling the body - you can wait until nighttime when they head to the higher levels to sleep. Then go out with a mask, gloves, and your bags to dispose of the remains. 

Definitely call 311 as well so they are aware, although it's not abnormal for a bird to pass away of older age when the weather turns. In my years living downtown, there's always a small bump in dead birds during the first few temp drops, especially as we get closer to the -15/-30 range. But if you start to see more members of the flock acting sick, or if you have another one pass in your yard or adjacent yards, you may want to let 311 know. 

Also, and I say this with utmost kindness, if you're putting out food but not cleaning feeders or feeding spots with soap, hot water, and bleach then you should probably stop feeding altogether. Improperly cleaned feeders can increase the risk of virus transmission among wild birds, which will only lead to more of them getting sick and dying. This also puts you, an immunocompromised person, at great risk of catching something as well. It's not worth it, especially with bird flu already present in AB.

First day of break and now 4th time since September I’ve been really sick (also a teacher responsible for hundreds of kids everyday- increased workload etc) first three times had to have antibiotics because it blossomed into chest infections each time and had 3 runs of absences to recover enough to breathe properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woke up today again nailed by whatever everyone has. Also did you know protocols for fevers and vomiting no longer result in being expected to stay home- and the government in this province like to pretend illness doesn’t exist while simultaneously cutting healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No time to recover from one illness before onto the next.&lt;/p&gt;

---------------------
To protect yourself against avian influenza, the following prevention measures are recommended: 

- **Stay up to date on all immunizations, especially the seasonal flu vaccine**.  
- Do not touch sick or dead animals or their droppings and do not bring sick wild animals into your home.  
- Keep your pets away from sick or dead animals and their feces (poo).  
- Report dead or sick birds or animals.  
--For poultry or livestock, contact the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Animal Health office:   https://inspection.canada.ca/en/about-cfia/contact-cfia-office-telephone#bc-animal. 
-- For pets, contact your veterinarian or call the BC Animal Health Centre at 1 800 661-9903. 
-- For wild birds, contact the BC Wild Bird Mortality Line: 1 866 431-2473. 
-- For wild mammals, contact the BC Wildlife Health Program: 1 250 751-7246. 

&gt;If you have been exposed to sick or dead birds or animals or work on farm where avian influenza has been detected, watch for symptoms of influenza-like illness (see link below for more details). If you get symptoms within 10 days after exposure to sick or dead animals, tell your health-care provider that you have been in contact with sick animals and are concerned about avian influenza.

As some have pointed out, H5 is referring to bird influenza.  Influenza A and B are most common to seasonally infect humans, although there are also influenza C and D.


All influenza viruses are labeled as H#N#, for example:
- H1N1=swine flu
- H5N1=bird flu
   - There are many more combinations. 

So, of these numbers:
- H stands for hemagglutinin
   - Protien on viral surface that binds to human receptors allowing the virus to enter the cell.
   - There are 16 subtypes of hemagglutinin 
- N stands for neuraminidase
   - Protein that helps newly formed viruses budding from an infected host cell to leave.
   - Cleaves sialic acid so viruses don't clump together on host receptor proteins and helps the virus move through mucus, increasing infective range.


When a virus moves from an animal to a human, we call it a zoonotic event.  But moving from animals to humans doesn't mean it can go from human to human efficiently.   Viruses need to adapt to humans to be able to continually infect us.


So 2 different things happen with influenza:
- Genetic drift: Mutations slowly over time from infecting many people.
   - This is how one seasons flu can be just different enough from last seasons to reinfect you next year.
- Genetic Shift: A quicker, more drastic version of gene changes.
   - So, influenza is comprised of 8 single-stranded RNA gene segments that make up their genome.  However, they regularly pack a few more segments than needed and can go up to about 11.
      - So one virion could actually be missing an essential gene segment so even with the correct H and N cannot reproduce after entering your cell.
      - Another virion could have more than needed and make it easier to get the best combinations of gene segments. 
   - During genetic shift 2 seperate subtypes of influenza viruses infect the same cell at the same time and can swap gene segments creating radical shifts quickly in the new virus.

As some have pointed out, H5 is referring to bird influenza.  Influenza A and B are most common to seasonally infect humans, although there are also influenza C and D.


All influenza viruses are labeled as H#N#, for example:
- H1N1=swine flu
- H5N1=bird flu
   - There are many more combinations. 

So, of these numbers:
- H stands for hemagglutinin
   - Protien on viral surface that binds to human receptors allowing the virus to enter the cell.
   - There are 16 subtypes of hemagglutinin 
- N stands for neuraminidase
   - Protein that helps newly formed viruses budding from an infected host cell to leave.
   - Cleaves sialic acid so viruses don't clump together on host receptor proteins and helps the virus move through mucus, increasing infective range.


When a virus moves from an animal to a human, we call it a zoonotic event.  But moving from animals to humans doesn't mean it can go from human to human efficiently.   Viruses need to adapt to humans to be able to continually infect us.


So 2 different things happen with influenza:
- Genetic drift: Mutations slowly over time from infecting many people.
   - This is how one seasons flu can be just different enough from last seasons to reinfect you next year.
- Genetic Shift: A quicker, more drastic version of gene changes.
   - So, influenza is comprised of 8 single-stranded RNA gene segments that make up their genome.  However, they regularly pack a few more segments than needed and can go up to about 11.
      - So one virion could actually be missing an essential gene segment so even with the correct H and N cannot reproduce after entering your cell.
      - Another virion could have more than needed and make it easier to get the best combinations of gene segments. 
   - During genetic shift 2 seperate subtypes of influenza viruses infect the same cell at the same time and can swap gene segments creating radical shifts quickly in the new virus.
      - In influenza zoonotic events, this is particularly problematic as the animal virus and human virus can recombine to make something that has the ability to enter human cells well, and enough differences that our body doesn't immediately notice it and can bypass some of our defenses.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian scientist here.

We would hear that no we could not discharge a person home on the weekend off the ward and have to wait until Monday or even later. When I started doing weekends in home care, I could see why...in my office only one nurse on day shift, but casuals like myself picking up heavy work relief as a second person on shift ...what used to be maybe 6-9 clients over time became 11 to 15, including driving, no less the ridiculous office admin crap after shift like faxing and emails. No time to allow for an admission (hour to hour and a half allotted including office prep and time in the home). So that pt who could not be discharged sat on the ward, taking a bed from an ER patient. Or would see patients on my inpatient unit who would be staying for even up to 6 months, or more, due to there not being beds in alternate level of care facilities....elderly are living longer.  Hell even in my training 32 yrs ago we were warned about the upcoming silver tsunami of old people coming. Obviously, in retrospect nothing was done to fully prepare for that. Even relatively ""young"" people are overall unhealthier, with comorbidities like obesity, heart disease, etc which burdens the acute inpatient bed situation and human resources further. People are sicker than when I first started and we are seeing things on wards that generations ago ..  you may be dead or would not have made it to ""x"" age or there was not the technology to save you/treat you. And I have not even begun to touch on things that affect health like access to preventative/primary care, mental health help, housing, the social safety net, food security, etc either


There is so much to be done at SO many levels that I don't even know where to begin. I have worked in (now) two provinces and two Territories in my nursing lifetime and it is the same shit, just a different pile. It wasn't one party in power to cause this but decades of short sighted decision making. 
Sounds cheesy but yes I got in this profession to help people because I care, but....I am sure I speak for all us frontliners in the system, not just in nursing, that I am tired of seeing the bean counters/higher ups have a meeting to decide if they need a meeting and just the utter beurocracy. We are drowning and I really believe we are witnessing the complete collapse of the health care system in it's current incarnation and things like COVID (and gawd forbid bird flu if it takes off/becomes human to human transmission) only revealed the fact that we are barely holding ourselves together more out in the open for all to see .

When I started doing weekends in home care, I could see why...in my office only one nurse on day shift, but casuals like myself picking up heavy work relief as a second person on shift ...what used to be maybe 6-9 clients over time became 11 to 15, including driving, no less the ridiculous office admin crap after shift like faxing and emails. No time to allow for an admission (hour to hour and a half allotted including office prep and time in the home). So that pt who could not be discharged sat on the ward, taking a bed from an ER patient. Or would see patients on my inpatient unit who would be staying for even up to 6 months, or more, due to there not being beds in alternate level of care facilities....elderly are living longer.  Hell even in my training 32 yrs ago we were warned about the upcoming silver tsunami of old people coming. Obviously, in retrospect nothing was done to fully prepare for that. Even relatively &amp;quot;young&amp;quot; people are overall unhealthier, with comorbidities like obesity, heart disease, etc which burdens the acute inpatient bed situation and human resources further. People are sicker than when I first started and we are seeing things on wards that generations ago ..  you may be dead or would not have made it to &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; age or there was not the technology to save you/treat you. And I have not even begun to touch on things that affect health like access to preventative/primary care, mental health help, housing, the social safety net, food security, etc either&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much to be done at SO many levels that I don&amp;#39;t even know where to begin. I have worked in (now) two provinces and two Territories in my nursing lifetime and it is the same shit, just a different pile. It wasn&amp;#39;t one party in power to cause this but decades of short sighted decision making. 
Sounds cheesy but yes I got in this profession to help people because I care, but....I am sure I speak for all us frontliners in the system, not just in nursing, that I am tired of seeing the bean counters/higher ups have a meeting to decide if they need a meeting and just the utter beurocracy. We are drowning and I really believe we are witnessing the complete collapse of the health care system in it&amp;#39;s current incarnation and things like COVID (and gawd forbid bird flu if it takes off/becomes human to human transmission) only revealed the fact that we are barely holding ourselves together more out in the open for all to see . Collapsing slowly at first, but like a snowball rolling downhill starting to gain momentum. Time to double check your seatbelts everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

No, it's based on a dozen or more sources, based on both single turbines and larger farms. There's a small argument about low level noise affecting wildlife, but it's no different than other man made sources.

&lt;p&gt;It would be a fuck of a lot easier for Americans to switch their own model to one more like ours. But decades of deregulation have made that near impossible because there are not many small, family owned egg farms left. They are all corporate owned which means the goal is to create profit, not a stable food supply.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the next three days, she developed a cough and diarrhea and began vomiting. She was taken back to the ER on Nov. 7 in respiratory distress and with a condition called hemodynamic instability, in which her body was unable to maintain consistent blood flow and pressure. She was admitted to the hospital.

As the disease progressed over the next few days, she was intubated and put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) — a life support technique that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs for patients with severe heart or lung conditions.

Because of concerns about the potential for a cytokine storm — a potentially lethal condition in which the body releases too many inflammatory molecules — she was put on a daily regimen of plasma exchange therapy, in which the patient’s plasma is removed in exchange for donated, health plasma.

As the days went by, her viral load began to decrease; on Nov. 16, eight days after she’d been admitted, she tested negative for the virus.

The authors of the report noted, however, that the viral load remained consistently higher in her lower lungs than in her upper respiratory tract — suggesting that the disease may manifest in places not currently tested for it (like the lower lungs) even as it disappears from those that are tested (like the mouth and nose).


She fully recovered and was discharged sometime after Nov. 28, when her intubation tube was removed.

Irrespective of where and when they occurred, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University in Providence, R.I., “it is worrisome because it indicates that the virus can change in a person and possibly cause a greater severity of symptoms than initial infection.”

The U.S. reported its first severe human case of bird flu on Wednesday in a Louisiana resident who is hospitalized in critical condition, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.

California, the country's most populous state, declared an emergency later Wednesday as the H5N1 virus spreads more widely in dairy herds. Data has shown 649 herds have tested positive since late August — roughly 60 per cent of the state total.

Partial viral genome data of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that infected the patient in Louisiana indicates the virus belongs to a genotype related to viruses recently detected in wild birds and poultry in the U.S. and in recent human cases in British Columbia and Washington state.

The D1.1 genotype of the virus differs from the one detected in dairy cows in the U.S. as well as human cases in multiple states and some poultry outbreaks in the country, the CDC said.

Bird flu has infected more than 860 dairy herds in 16 states since March and killed 123 million poultry since the outbreak began in 2022.

We don't have egg megafarms like in the US so bird flu hasn't spread like wildfire leading to massive chicken culls like in the US.

The very, very last thing we should do is give the US greater access to the market. The national #1 priority for Canada right now should be to lessen reliance on the US. Imagine how we would hold up if we had allowed their massively directly subsidized megafarmed dairy industry to slaughter ours through dumping and were now reliant on the US for our dairy. The US would have yet another lever to hurt us and this time straight in the stomach.

&gt;I get why U.S. farmers are ticked. They want access to our market.

Perhaps they do, but do they deserve it? The only reason they want ever increasing access is to dump their product in our market to kill off our producers and take over. It's a strategy the US has repeatedly used throughout its history. Trump is obviously trying to wedge their dairy in Canada to further his 51st state agenda. Nothing he wants is even a win-win. We are always going to lose if he has his way.

No further access for the US in our agricultural markets. I generally support supply management but I'm not a zealot - if we want to stimulate competition in our supply managed markets, we can open it up further to importation, but it should be from like-minded blocs or countries like EU, UK, AUS, NZ that generally have similar food safety standards as we do and who aren't looking to devastate our economy for their own gain.

The Americans can go fuck themselves. They can put on dairy tariffs for all I care, we don't even really export it to them. But we should put 250% tariffs on their allowed USMCA quota if they do, simply killing off their access entirely.

Also, this article is lying. The 250% tariffs Canada imposes on US dairy only apply after a certain threshold. This threshold is an anti-dumping measure because of US direct subsidies. More than $400 million of US dairy is allowed into Canada tariff-free, mostly dairy byproducts. That threshold was raised when NAFTA was renegotiated by Trump in 2016 with his so-called ""best deal ever"". But then again we can't expect American ""news"" to be factual.

 *In 2025, eight states — Arizona, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon and Washington — have laws in place that ban the production and sale of conventional eggs for animal welfare reasons. National retailers like Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods have made similar commitments.*

*Many of those states recently experienced major outbreaks of bird flu. In fact, bird flu had a disproportionate impact on cage-free egg layers in 2024. About a third of U.S. egg layers are cage-free hens, but they contributed nearly 60% of all bird flu cases for the year.* 

*Not only does that mean the supply of cage-free eggs is down everywhere — which, as explained above, leads to higher prices — but it also has implications for how quickly supplies can recover, which are unique to cage-free eggs.* 

*Already there are fewer sources for cage-free eggs. On top of that, in places where cage-free egg rules are in place, it can be tricky for retailers to find new suppliers that comply with whatever regulations the stores are required to follow.* 

*As a result, grocery shoppers living in states or shopping in stores that restrict the sale of conventional eggs are especially likely to face higher prices, quantity restrictions and temporary egg shortages.*

Here's a couple key points.

1. **Feeding Encourages Them to Stay Where They Shouldn't** — Feeding attracts large concentrations of waterfowl to areas that can’t naturally support such numbers. Left on their own, ducks and geese will occupy areas that provide sufficient natural food. 
2. **Feeding Can Spread Disease Between Flocks** — Artificial feeding encourages unnaturally large flocks to gather in one place where the competition for food can cause unnecessary stress. This may weaken the birds and make them more susceptible to disease. Also, birds crowded into these areas are defecating in the same location where they’re feeding. ***(This is particularly problematic when bird flu comes through.)***
3. **Feeding Disrupts the Duck's Natural Life Cycle** — Alternatively, artificial feeding may allow frail birds to survive, reproduce, and diminish the species as a whole.

However, others are correct - bird flu is circulating and you should take measures to protect yourself first. Wear a mask if you have one, get gloves and double bag the remains. If you want to do it without being swooped - as magpies will ""investigate"" a deceased flockmate and may think you're the reason they died if they see you handling the body - you can wait until nighttime when they head to the higher levels to sleep. Then go out with a mask, gloves, and your bags to dispose of the remains. 

Definitely call 311 as well so they are aware, although it's not abnormal for a bird to pass away of older age when the weather turns. In my years living downtown, there's always a small bump in dead birds during the first few temp drops, especially as we get closer to the -15/-30 range. But if you start to see more members of the flock acting sick, or if you have another one pass in your yard or adjacent yards, you may want to let 311 know. 

Also, and I say this with utmost kindness, if you're putting out food but not cleaning feeders or feeding spots with soap, hot water, and bleach then you should probably stop feeding altogether. Improperly cleaned feeders can increase the risk of virus transmission among wild birds, which will only lead to more of them getting sick and dying.

As for the 3-5% claim, that again is shown to be made up by looking at actual sources. Its actually about twice that.

&lt;p&gt;There are currently 162,586,638 commercial Birds Affected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses have been detected in U.S. wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard or hobbyist flocks beginning in January 2022. These are &lt;strong&gt;the first detections of HPAI A(H5) viruses in the U.S. since 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Between 2005 and 2020, HPAI A viruses resulted in the death and mass slaughter of more than 246 million poultry worldwide, with peaks in 2006 and 2016, according to WOAH. During the peaks in 2006 and 2016, about a quarter of the world&amp;#39;s countries were affected with HPAI A viruses, according to WOAH&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the 3-5% claim, that again is shown to be made up by looking at actual sources. Its actually about twice that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of recurrent outbreaks, U.S. egg inventories were &lt;strong&gt;29% lower&lt;/strong&gt; in the final week of December 2022 than at the beginning of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be very wary of these grifters trying to blame everything on &amp;quot;greed&amp;quot; with some vague hand-waving, as they also have their hand out asking you for money. Yes, for profit companies are obviously motivated by profit. But that is not new, and to claim bird flu is not a major impact here is just not what the actual experts and data says at all. Regardless of what tik tok lady in her car claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;Prevention measures
---------------------
To protect yourself against avian influenza, the following prevention measures are recommended: 

- **Stay up to date on all immunizations, especially the seasonal flu vaccine**.  
- Do not touch sick or dead animals or their droppings and do not bring sick wild animals into your home.  
- Keep your pets away from sick or dead animals and their feces (poo).  
- Report dead or sick birds or animals.  
--For poultry or livestock, contact the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Animal Health office:   https://inspection.canada.ca/en/about-cfia/contact-cfia-office-telephone#bc-animal. 
-- For pets, contact your veterinarian or call the BC Animal Health Centre at 1 800 661-9903. 
-- For wild birds, contact the BC Wild Bird Mortality Line: 1 866 431-2473. 
-- For wild mammals, contact the BC Wildlife Health Program: 1 250 751-7246. 

&gt;If you have been exposed to sick or dead birds or animals or work on farm where avian influenza has been detected, watch for symptoms of influenza-like illness (see link below for more details). If you get symptoms within 10 days after exposure to sick or dead animals, tell your health-care provider that you have been in contact with sick animals and are concerned about avian influenza. This will help them give you appropriate advice on testing and treatment.

As some have pointed out, H5 is referring to bird influenza.  Influenza A and B are most common to seasonally infect humans, although there are also influenza C and D.


All influenza viruses are labeled as H#N#, for example:
- H1N1=swine flu
- H5N1=bird flu
   - There are many more combinations. 

So, of these numbers:
- H stands for hemagglutinin
   - Protien on viral surface that binds to human receptors allowing the virus to enter the cell.
   - There are 16 subtypes of hemagglutinin 
- N stands for neuraminidase
   - Protein that helps newly formed viruses budding from an infected host cell to leave.
   - Cleaves sialic acid so viruses don't clump together on host receptor proteins and helps the virus move through mucus, increasing infective range.


When a virus moves from an animal to a human, we call it a zoonotic event.  But moving from animals to humans doesn't mean it can go from human to human efficiently.   Viruses need to adapt to humans to be able to continually infect us.


So 2 different things happen with influenza:
- Genetic drift: Mutations slowly over time from infecting many people.
   - This is how one seasons flu can be just different enough from last seasons to reinfect you next year.
- Genetic Shift: A quicker, more drastic version of gene changes.
   - So, influenza is comprised of 8 single-stranded RNA gene segments that make up their genome.  However, they regularly pack a few more segments than needed and can go up to about 11.
      - So one virion could actually be missing an essential gene segment so even with the correct H and N cannot reproduce after entering your cell.
      - Another virion could have more than needed and make it easier to get the best combinations of gene segments. 
   - During genetic shift 2 seperate subtypes of influenza viruses infect the same cell at the same time and can swap gene segments creating radical shifts quickly in the new virus.

As some have pointed out, H5 is referring to bird influenza.  Influenza A and B are most common to seasonally infect humans, although there are also influenza C and D.


All influenza viruses are labeled as H#N#, for example:
- H1N1=swine flu
- H5N1=bird flu
   - There are many more combinations. 

So, of these numbers:
- H stands for hemagglutinin
   - Protien on viral surface that binds to human receptors allowing the virus to enter the cell.
   - There are 16 subtypes of hemagglutinin 
- N stands for neuraminidase
   - Protein that helps newly formed viruses budding from an infected host cell to leave.
   - Cleaves sialic acid so viruses don't clump together on host receptor proteins and helps the virus move through mucus, increasing infective range.


When a virus moves from an animal to a human, we call it a zoonotic event.  But moving from animals to humans doesn't mean it can go from human to human efficiently.   Viruses need to adapt to humans to be able to continually infect us.


So 2 different things happen with influenza:
- Genetic drift: Mutations slowly over time from infecting many people.
   - This is how one seasons flu can be just different enough from last seasons to reinfect you next year.
- Genetic Shift: A quicker, more drastic version of gene changes.

      - Another virion could have more than needed and make it easier to get the best combinations of gene segments. 
   - During genetic shift 2 seperate subtypes of influenza viruses infect the same cell at the same time and can swap gene segments creating radical shifts quickly in the new virus.

[https://inspection.canada.ca/en/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/avian-influenza/latest-bird-flu-situation/hpai-livestock/milk-sampling-and-testing](https://inspection.canada.ca/en/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/avian-influenza/latest-bird-flu-situation/hpai-livestock/milk-sampling-and-testing)

Of course, raw milk is not pasteurized. Sadly, when the CDC issued a warning to not drink raw milk, sales went up in the US: [https://globalnews.ca/news/10499956/bird-flu-raw-milk-sales-spiking/](https://globalnews.ca/news/10499956/bird-flu-raw-milk-sales-spiking/)",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],True,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;BC has 22 of the 24 avian flu infected chicken flocks in Canada. &lt;a href=""https://inspection.canada.ca/en/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/avian-influenza/latest-bird-flu-situation/status-ongoing-response""&gt;https://inspection.canada.ca/en/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/avian-influenza/latest-bird-flu-situation/status-ongoing-response&lt;/a&gt; — and over half of the estimated number of birds impacted in the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in August, US esearchers reported &lt;a href=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.11.24311811v1""&gt;17% of dairy samples&lt;/a&gt; from US grocery store shelves had avian flu fragments. That was apparently judged as fine because pasteurization kills avian flu in milk and cheese and they didn&amp;#39;t want to disrupt food costs or make farmers change their practices.

I can write out the implications of these for a person with bird flu to help educate you though:

1. Teen is in PICU. What happens if they require any procedural or operative management which would require anesthesia while in this setting? A greater amount of anesthesia would likely be required. It would be more difficult to intubate someone with obesity due to obstruction in vision fo the airway. It would be more difficult to bag-mask ventilate them if that was needed.

2. Teen has bird flu - with upper respiratory tract symptomology. The mechanics of their body make them require greater effort to expand their chest wall; move their diaphragm; while having more parietal and visceral fat that impedes this. This means its requires MORE work to breath when there is a higher BMI. I wonder if this would make ANY impact on someone with a respiratory issue? I hope your common sense figures this one out.

3. An individual with obesity carries more risk factors -- increased insulin resistance through metabolic syndrome; increase risk of co-morbidity such as heart disease, heart failure; increase risk of immunocompromise through vascular diseases, through diabetes.
