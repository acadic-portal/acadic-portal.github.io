# Welcome to ACADIC

Nesessary JavaScript libraries required for hosting [ACADIC portal](https://acadic.org) could be found in this repository. 
GitHub Pages enable .js files to get updated, regularly. To use GitHub Pages, the repository must be public and named as ***[username]*.github.io** . 
In settings>code and automation>Pages>Build and Deployment, the *Source* should be set to "Deploy from a branch" and the *Branch* should be set to "None". Maybe [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) could help further. To insert the library use the code below:

`  <script src="https://username.github.io/file.js"> </script>  `

To access a GitHub account using Python, a token needs to be produced. To create a token, uner the profile image, click settings. 
In Developer settings>Personal access tokens click on "Generate new token" and then on "Generate new token (classic)". 
In the "Select scopes" select repo and generate the token.  Now, a Python script could be written to update the files in the repositories.

Please kindly cite us, if you use any of our files/datasets. Thank you in advance.
